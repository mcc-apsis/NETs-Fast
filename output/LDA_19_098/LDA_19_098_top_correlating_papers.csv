   Jones, CW";"The measurement of isosteric heats of adsorption of silica supported amine materials in the low pressure range (0-0.1 bar) is critical for understanding the interactions between CO2 and amine sites at low coverage and hence to the development of efficient amine adsorbents for CO2 capture from flue gas and ambient air. Heats of adsorption for an array of silica-supported amine materials are experimentally measured at low coverage using a Calvet calorimeter equipped with a customized dosing manifold. In a series of 3-aminopropyl-functionalized silica materials, higher amine densities resulted in higher isosteric heats of adsorption, clearly showing that the density/proximity of amine sites can influence the amine efficiency of adsorbents. In a series of materials with fixed amine loading but different amine types, strongly basic primary and secondary amine materials are shown to have essentially identical heats of adsorption near 90 kJ/mol. However, the adsorption uptakes vary substantially as a function of CO2 partial pressure for different primary and secondary amines, demonstrating that entropic contributions to adsorption may play a key role in adsorption at secondary amine sites, making adsorption at these sites less efficient at the low coverages that are important to the direct capture of CO2 from ambient air. Thus, while primary amines are confirmed to be the most effective amine types for CO2 capture from ambient air, this is not due to enhanced enthalpic contributions associated with primary amines over secondary amines, but may be due to unfavorable entropic factors associated with organization of the second alkyl chain on the secondary amine during CO2 adsorption. Given this hypothesis, favorable entropic factors may be the main reason primary amine based adsorbents are more effective under air capture conditions.";"34";"WOS:000342328200025";2014;"captur, air, adsorpt, materi, adsorb";0.972714477959309;196

   conductivity and DOC leaching of biochar-sand mixtures";"Liu, ZL

   Gallagher, ME
   Gonnermann, H";"The amendment of soil with biochar can sequester carbon and alter hydrologic properties by changing physical and chemical characteristics of soil. To understand the effect of biochar amendment on soil hydrology, we measured the hydraulic conductivity (K) of biochar-sand mixtures as well as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in leachate. Specifically, we assessed the effects of biochar concentration and particle size on K and amount of DOC in the soil leachate. To better understand how physical properties influenced K, we also measured the skeletal density of biochars and sand, and the bulk density, the water saturation, and the porosity of biochar-sand mixtures. Our model soil was sand (0.251-0.853 mm) with biochar rates from 2 to 10 wt% (g biochar/g total soil x 100%). As biochar (<0.853 mm) concentration increased from 0 to 10 wt%, K decreased by 72 +/- 3%.
   When biochar particle size was equal to, greater than, and less than particle size of sand, we found that biochar in different particle sizes have different effects on K. For a 2 wt% biochar rate, K decreased by 72 +/- 2% when biochar particles were finer than sand particles, and decreased by 15 +/- 2% when biochar particles were coarser than sand particles. When biochar and sand particle size were comparable, we observed no significant effect on K. We propose that the decrease of K through the addition of fine biochar was because finer biochar particles filled spaces between sand particles, which increased tortuosity and reduced pore throat size of the mixture. The decrease of K associated with coarser biochar was caused by the bimodal particle size distribution, resulting in more compact packing and increased tortuosity.
   The loss of biochar C as DOC was related to both biochar rate and particle size. The cumulative DOC loss was 1350% higher from 10 wt% biochar compared to pure sand. This large increase reflected the very small DOC yield from pure sand. In addition, DOC in the leachate decreased as biochar particle size increased. For all treatments, the fraction of carbon lost as DOC ranged from 0.06 to 0.18 wt% of biochar. These experiments suggest that mixing sandy soils with biochar is likely to reduce infiltration rates, holding water near the surface longer with little loss of biochar-derived carbon to groundwater and streams.

"Potassium incorporated alumina based CO2 capture sorbents: Comparison
   with supported amine sorbents under ultra-dilute capture conditions";"Bali, S
   Sakwa-Novak, MA
   Jones, CW";"Amines supported on silica or alumina supports are among the most well-studied sorbents for CO2 capture from ultra-dilute sources, such as ambient air. Another class of sorbents that may also bind CO2 strongly enough to function well under ultra-dilute conditions are supported alkali metal based compositions. In this work, the synthesis of alumina-supported potassium (AlK) via calcination of impregnated potassium acetate is described and the resulting materials are evaluated for CO2 capture under ultra-dilute conditions (1% CO2), including under simulated air capture conditions (400 ppm CO2). The sorbents are evaluated at different adsorption and regeneration temperatures alongside two benchmark alumina-supported amine sorbents. The potassium-alumina sorbents are found to adsorb more CO2 than the amine benchmark sorbent at the tested 1% CO2 conditions, whereas the amine sorbent yielded a higher uptake under simulated air capture conditions of 400 ppm. Abbreviated adsorption isotherms are measured for the potassium-alumina sorbents at three temperatures, the isotherms are fit to a single site Toth adsorption model, and the assembled data are utilized to estimate the heat of adsorption using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The isosteric heat of adsorption for the potassium based sorbent is higher than those estimated and measured for amine based sorbents, which is consistent with the higher regeneration temperature required by the potassium based sorbents. Potassium-alumina sorbents may be useful adsorbents for ultra-dilute conditions due to their stability in oxygen relative to amine sorbents if plentiful heat is available for the significant temperature swings needed to effectively cycle the sorbents.

   Shen, XD";"The objective of this research was to develop a high-performance CO2 adsorbent by a simple, cost-effective and environmental-friendly route based on amine hybrid aerogel. A new amine hybrid titania/silsesquioxane composite aerogel (AHTSA) was prepared by a one-pot sol-gel process followed by supercritical drying (SCD). The wet gel was obtained by orderly mixing all the reactants in a container without adding any catalyst. SCD was conducted without contaminant emission. Effects of amine loading and CO2 concentration on pores structure and CO2 adsorption performance of AHTSA were investigated. Higher amine loading leads to lower specific surface area and mesopore volume of AHTSA, due to the increase of large pores and diminishment of mesopores when increasing the amine loading. Resulting from the sharp decrease of the surface area, overdosing of the amine precursor negatively affects the surface amine content of AHTSA and thus reduces its CO2 adsorption capacity. High CO2 concentration favors the CO2 adsorption capacity and rate as concentrated CO2 favors the CO2 diffusion in the pore space of the adsorbent, enhances the interaction between CO2 and surface amine groups. The dry CO2 adsorption capacity of AHTSA increases from 1.64, 4.19 to 6.66 mmol/g when the CO2 concentration of the mixture gas varies from 400 ppm (air), 1% to 10%. Short adsorption halftime and high amine efficiency of AHTSA with different CO2 concentrations reveal that AHTSA is a dynamic and effective adsorbent for CO2 capture, even direct air capture.

The nonpolar resin HP20 was suitable for PEI loading was 50 wt %. On the basis of the pore size distribution of the resin before and after PEI modification, it can be found that mesopores of <43 nm were mainly responsible for PEI loading and pores in the range of 43-68 nm were probably favorable for CO2 diffusion. The adsorbed amount of CO2 on HP20/PEI-50 decreased with increasing adsorption temperature because of the dominant role of exothermic reaction of CO2 adsorption. The adsorption of CO2 on the adsorbent was very fast, and sorption equilibrium was achieved within 6 min at 75 degrees C. HP20/PEI-50 almost kept a stable adsorption capacity for CO2 at concentrations of 15 vol % and 400 ppm in the consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles, and its adsorption capacity was 181 mg/g from pure CO2 and 99.3 mg/g from 400 ppm CO2 at 25 degrees C, higher than all PEI-modified materials reported. The high volume-based amount of CO2 adsorbed on HP20/PEI-50 (96.0 mg/cm(3) at 25 degrees C and 84.5 mg/cm(3) at 75 degrees C for pure CO2) is beneficial to reducing the required volume of the adsorption bed for CO2 capture.

The resulting materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results showed that the introduction of swelling agents effectively enlarged the pore diameter and pore volume of the SBA-15 materials, and pore swelling with isooctane was larger than that with CCl4. When modified with tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), all of these composite materials exhibited excellent adsorption capacities for CO2. The adsorption capacity of CO2 was independent of the pore structure, if the template was removed before modification with TEPA. By contrast, the adsorption capacity increased with the pore diameter when the as-synthesized mesoporous material was modified with TEPA. The effects of temperature and pressure on the CO2 adsorption capacity were investigated using adsorption isotherms and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). With CO2 adsorption at higher temperature, the composite materials showed different adsorption capacities with pressure variation. As a result, the adsorption and separation of CO2 on these TEPA modified mesoporous materials in ambient air flow can be realized via pressure swing adsorption.";"6";"WOS:000302764400037";2012;"captur, air, adsorpt, materi, adsorb";0.955381265435449;196

Owing to the recognized impact of atmospheric CO2 on global climate change, the study of the use of amine-oxide hybrid materials as CO2 sorbents has exploded in the past decade. While the majority of the work has concerned separation of CO2 from dilute mixtures such as flue gas from coal-fired power plants, it has been recognized by us and others that such supported amine materials are also perhaps uniquely suited to extract CO2 from ultradilute gas mixtures, such as ambient air. As unique, low temperature chemisorbents, they can operate under ambient conditions, spontaneously extracting CO2 from ambient air, while being regenerated under mild conditions using heat or the combination of heat and vacuum.
   This Account describes the evolution of our activities on the design of amine-functionalized silica materials for catalysis to the design, characterization, and utilization of these materials in CO2 separations. New materials developed in our laboratory, such as hyperbranched aminosilica materials, and previously known amine-oxide hybrid compositions, have been extensively studied for CO2 extraction from simulated ambient air (400 ppm of CO2). The role of amine type and structure (molecular, polymeric), support type and structure, the stability of the various compositions under simulated operating conditions, and the nature of the adsorbed CO2 have been investigated in detail. The requirements for an effective, practical air capture process have been outlined and the ability of amine oxide hybrid materials to meet these needs has been discussed. Ultimately, the practicality of such a \"direct air capture\" process is predicated not only on the physicochemical properties of the sorbent, but also how the sorbent operates in a practical process that offers a scalable gas solid contacting strategy. In this regard, the utility of low pressure drop monolith contactors is suggested to offer a practical mode of amine sorbent/air contacting for direct air capture.";"10";"WOS:000363347900005";2015;"captur, air, adsorpt, materi, adsorb";0.950682816524226;196

   Sun, CL";"Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important component of agricultural soil. Understanding the storage of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) helps us understand how ecosystems would respond to natural and anthropogenic disturbances under different management strategies. Although the quantity of SOC stocks in the Loess Plateau has been previously investigated, the distribution and storage of C in its deep soil layers has been poorly studied to date. The present study was conducted in the Zhifanggou Watershed on the Loess Plateau to evaluate the effect of the types of land use on the distribution and storage of SOC and total nitrogen (TN) at different soil depths. Ten types of land use were investigated: woodland (Robinia pseudoacacia), shrubland (Caragana korshinskii; Hippophae rhamnoides), natural grassland, artificial grassland (Medicago sativa), orchard, check-dam cropland, terraced cropland (Setaria italica; Zea mays), and sloped cropland. The results show that land use significantly affects the SOC and TN content. The reconversion of sloped croplands into forestlands and grasslands improve their SOC and TN content. Natural grassland, terraced cropland with Z. mays, and the artificial grassland had the highest SOC content within 0-60 cm, 60-100 cm, and 150-500 cm layers, respectively. The SOC and TN content in the top layer were higher than those in the deep layer. Natural grassland had the highest SOC and TN storage within 0-40 cm layer, followed by shrubland I (C. korshinskii), check-dam cropland, woodland, and shrubland II (H. rhamnoides), orchard and artificial grassland, whereas the sloped cropland, and the terraced cropland with S. italica had the lowest values. The SOC and TN storage between the top (0 -20 cm) and deep layers (0-100 cm, 0-300 cm, and 0-500 cm) can be modeled using linear function (y = ax + b). The results suggest that natural grasslands may be the optimal choice for SOC and TN sequestration in the Zhifanggou Watershed. Shrublands, woodland, artificial grasslands, orchards, terrace cropland with Z. mays and check-dam croplands are also recommended for their great contribution to SOC and TN storage in the area.

Underwater irradiance, chlorophyll a (Chl a), photochemical efficiency, and primary productivity were measured inside and outside of an iron-enriched patch in order to quantify the response of phytoplankton to iron fertilization. Chl a concentration and photosynthetic rate (C-14 uptake in simulated in situ incubations) were measured in pico-, nano-, and microphytoplankton. Photochemical efficiency was studied with fast repetition rate fluorometry and xenon-pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry. The high-nutrient low-chlorophyll waters outside the Fe-enriched patch were characterized by deep euphotic zones (63-72 m), low Chl a (48-56 mg m(-2)), low photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m approximate to 0.3), and low daily primary productivity (130-220 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). Between 70 and 90% of Chl a was found in pico- and nanophytoplankton. During the induced bloom, F-v/F-m increased up to similar to0.55, primary productivity and Chl a reached the maximum values of 790 mg C m(-2) d(-1) and 231 mg Chl a m(-2), respectively. As a consequence, the euphotic depth decreased to similar to41 m. Picophytoplankton biomass hardly changed. Nano- and microphytoplankton biomass increased. In the first 2 weeks of the experiment, when the depth of the upper mixed layer was mostly <40 m, primary productivity was highly correlated with Chl a. In the third week, productivity was much lower than predicted from Chl a, probably because of a reduction in photosynthetic capacity as a consequence of increased physical variability in the upper water column. These results provide unequivocal evidence that iron supply is the central factor controlling phytoplankton primary productivity in the Southern Ocean, even if the mixing depth is >80 m.";"168";"WOS:000178081800005";2002;"ocean, iron, weather, releas, day";0.942800394238283;141

Here we investigate this event with a one-dimensional ocean biogeochemical column model to illuminate the ocean response to iron fertilisation by volcanic ash. The results indicate that the added iron triggered a phytoplankton bloom in the summer of 2008. Associated with this bloom, macronutrient concentrations such as nitrate and silicate decline and zooplankton biomass is enhanced in the ocean mixed layer. The simulated development of the drawdown of carbon dioxide and increase of pH in surface seawater is in good agreement with available observations. Sensitivity studies with different supply dates of iron to the ocean emphasise the favourable oceanic conditions in the NE Pacific to generate massive phytoplankton blooms in particular during July and August in comparison to other months.

Adsorption isotherms of the sorbent material are experimentally determined by thermogravimetry and fitted to isotherm models, which are successfully applied to predict desorption capacities achieved in the TVS process.

In contrast to CH(3)Br, no change was observed in the concentrations of bromoform (in-patch day 11 and out-patch day 11: 1.7 and 1.7 pmol L(-1)), dibromomethane (2.1 and 2.2 pmol L(-1)), and dibromochloromethane (1.0 and 1.2 pmol L(-1), respectively). The concentration of isoprene, which is known to have a relationship with chlorophyll a, did not change in this study. The responses of trace gases during SEEDS II differed from the previous findings (in situ iron enrichment experiment-EisenEx, Southern Ocean iron experiment-SOFeX, and Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study-SERIES). Thus, in order to estimate the concomitant effect of iron fertilization on the climate, it is important to assess the induction of biological activity and the distributions/air-sea fluxes of trace gases by iron addition.

"An in situ iron-enrichment experiment in the western subarctic Pacific
   (SEEDS): Introduction and summary";"Takeda, S
   Tsuda, A";"To test the iron hypothesis in the subarctic Pacific Ocean, an in situ iron-enrichment experiment (SEEDS) was performed in the western subarctic gyre in July-August 2001. About 350 kg of iron (as acidic iron sulfate) and 0.48 mol of the inert chemical tracer sulfur hexafluoride were introduced into a 10-m deep surface mixed layer over an 80 km(2) area. This single iron infusion raised dissolved iron levels to &SIM; 2.9 nM initially. Dissolved iron concentrations rapidly decreased after the infusion, but levels remained close to 0.15 nM even at the end of the 14-day experimental period. During SEEDS there were iron-mediated increases in chlorophyll a concentrations (up to 20 &mu; g l(-1)), primary production rates, biomass and photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency relative to waters outside the iron-enriched patch. The rapid and very high accumulation of phytoplankton biomass in response to the iron addition appeared to be partly attributable to shallow mixed-layer depth and moderate water temperature in the western subarctic Pacific. However, the main reason was a floristic shift to fast-growing centric diatom Chaetoceros debilis, unlike the previous iron-enrichment experiments in the equatorial Pacific and the Southern Ocean, in both of which iron stimulated the growth of pennate diatoms. The iron-mediated blooming of diatoms resulted in a marked consumption of macronutrients and drawdown of pCO(2). Biological and physiological measurements indicate that phytoplankton growth in the patch became both light- and iron-limited, making phytoplankton biomass relatively constant after day 9. The increase in microzooplankton grazing rate after day 9 also influenced the net growth rate of phytoplankton. There was no significant increase in the export flux of carbon to depth during the 14-day occupation of the experimental site. The export flux between day 4 and day 13 was estimated to be only 13% of the integrated primary production in the iron-enriched patch. The major part of the carbon fixed by the diatom bloom remained in the surface mixed layer as biogenic particulate matter. Our findings support the hypothesis that iron limits phytoplankton growth and biomass in a 'bottom up' manner in this area, but the fate of algal carbon remains unknown. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Southern Ocean iron enrichment promotes inorganic carbon drawdown";"Bakker, DCE

   Law, CS";"The effect of iron supply on phytoplankton growth and the marine carbon cycle was tested in situ at 61 degreesS 141 degreesE in the Southern Ocean Iron Release Experiment (SOIREE). On 9 February 1999 iron and the tracer sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) were added to the mixed layer with additional iron infusions after 3, 5 and 7 days. A small decrease of the fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO(2)) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by iron-induced algal growth was observed 4-5 days after the first infusion. From then onwards fCO(2) and DIC steadily decreased, and the iron-enriched waters became a sink for atmospheric CO2. The region with surface-water fCO(2) drawdown closely matched the shape of the patch, as indicated by SF6. Surface-water fCO(2) and DIC drawdown were relatively constant across the patch, whereas SF6 decreased from the patch centre outwards. This pointed to uniform algal carbon uptake, not limited by iron, in the patch. After 13 days surface-water fCO(2) and DIC in the patch centre had decreased by 32-38 mu atm and 15-18 mu mol kg(-1), respectively. Surface-water fCO(2) outside the patch had increased by 8 mu atm, partly as a result of surface-water warming. The iron-induced fCO(2) change exceeded seasonal fCO(2) variability in this region by a factor of two. From the surface-water fCO(2) distribution we estimate a net DIC drawdown of 1353 t of carbon (+/- 14%) (1 t = 10(6) g) across the patch after 12 days, assuming uniform drawdown in the upper 50 m. Correction for vertical diffusion and air-sea exchange results in a gross DIC drawdown of 1408 t of carbon. The decrease of fCO(2) and DIG, integrated over the mixed layer, was remarkably similar in size after 13 days of SOIREE as changes observed after 6-9 days during IronEx II, if we consider the 4-5 days lag in algal carbon uptake at the Southern Ocean site. SOIREE has demonstrated in situ the occurrence of algal iron limitation and of iron-induced carbon uptake in these Southern Ocean waters. The subsequent fate of the fixed inorganic carbon can only be speculated upon. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   Abraham, ER";"Active fluorescence (fast repetition rate fluorometry, FRRF) was used to follow the photosynthetic response of the phytoplankton community during the 13-day Southern Ocean Iron RElease Experiment (SOIREE). This in situ iron enrichment was conducted in the polar waters of the Australasian-Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean in February 1999. Iron fertilisation of these high nitrate low chlorophyll (HNLC) waters resulted in an increase in the photosynthetic competence (F-v/F-m,) of the resident cells from around 0.20 to greater than 0.60 (i.e. close to the theoretical maximum) by 10/11 days after the first enrichment. Although a significant iron-mediated response in F-v/F-m was detected as early as 24h after the initial fertilisation, the increase in F-v/F-m to double ambient levels took 6 days, This response was five-fold slower than observed in iron enrichments tin situ and in vitro) in the HNLC waters of the subarctic and equatorial Pacific, Although little is known about the relationship between water temperature and F-v/F-m, it is likely that low water temperatures - and possibly the deep mixed layer - were responsible for this slow response time, During SOIREE, the photosynthetic competence of the resident phytoplankton in iron-enriched waters increased at dissolved iron levels above 0.2 nM, suggesting that iron limitation was alleviated at this concentration, Increases in F-v/F-m of cells within four algal size classes suggested that all taxa displayed a photosynthetic response to iron enrichment. Other physiological proxies of algal iron stress (such as flavodoxin levels in diatoms) exhibited different temporal trends to iron-enrichment than F-v/F-m during the time-course of SOIREE, The relationship between F-v/F-m, algal growth rate and such proxies in Southern Ocean waters is discussed.

"Oceanic iron fertilization: one of strategies for sequestration
   atmospheric CO2";"Song, JM";"Carbon cycle is connected with the most important environmental issue of Global Change. As one of the major carbon reservoirs, oceans play an important part in the carbon cycle. In recent years, iron seems to give us a good news that oceanic iron fertilization could stimulate biological productivity as CO2 sink of human-produced CO2. Oceanic iron fertilization experiments have verified that adding iron into high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) seawaters can increase phytoplankton production and export organic carbon, and hence increase carbon sink of anthropogenic CO2, to reduce global warming. In sixty days, the export organic carbon could reach 10 000 times for adding iron by model prediction and in situ experiment, i.e. the atmospheric CO2 uptake and inorganic carbon drawdown in upper seawaters also have the same magnitude. Therefore, oceanic iron fertilization is one of the strategies for increasing carbon sink of anthropogenic CO2. The paper is focused on the iron fertilization, especially in situ ocean iron experiments in order that the future research is more efficient.";"10";"WOS:000184694100006";2003;"ocean, iron, weather, releas, day";0.92368060466886;141

The Southern Ocean iron enrichment experiment, an iron fertilization experiment in the waters closest to Antarctica, resulted in a 9-fold increase in chlorophyll (Chl) concentration and a 5-fold increase in integrated primary production. Upon iron addition, the maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis (phi(m)) rapidly doubled, from 0.011 to 0.025 mol C.mol quanta(-1). Paradoxically, this increase in light-limited productivity was not accompanied by a significant increase in light-saturated productivity (P-max(b)). P-max(b) maximum Chl normalized productivity, was 1.34 mg C.mg Chl(-1).h(-1) outside and 1.49 mg C.mg Chl(-1)-h(-1) inside the iron-enriched patch. The importance of phi(m) as compared with P-max(b) in controlling the biological response to iron addition has vast implications for understanding the ecological response to iron. We show that an iron-driven increase in phi(m) is the proximate physiological mechanism affected by iron addition and can account for most of the increases in primary production. The relative importance of phi(m) over P-max(b) in this iron-fertilized bloom highlights the limitations of often-used primary productivity algorithms that are driven by estimates of P-max(b) but largely ignore variability in phi(m) and light-limited productivity. To use primary productivity models that include variability in iron supply in prediction or forecasting, the variability of light-limited productivity must be resolved.";"30";"WOS:000254772700044";2008;"ocean, iron, weather, releas, day";0.916718149992811;141

   Zhao, DS";"Grassland ecosystem is an important component of the terrestrial carbon cycle system. Clear comprehension of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and potential of grasslands is very important for the effective management of grassland ecosystems. Grasslands in Inner Mongolia have undergone evident impacts from human activities and natural factors in recent decades. To explore the changes of carbon sequestration capacity of grasslands from 2000 to 2012, we carried out studies on the estimation of SOC storage and potential of grasslands in central and eastern Inner Mongolia, China based on field investigations and MODIS image data. First, we calculated vegetation cover using the dimidiate pixel model based on MODIS-EVI images. Following field investigations of aboveground biomass and plant height, we used a grassland quality evaluation model to get the grassland evaluation index, which is typically used to represent grassland quality. Second, a correlation regression model was established between grassland evaluation index and SOC density. Finally, by this regression model, we calculated the SOC storage and potential of the studied grasslands. Results indicated that SOC storage increased with fluctuations in the study area, and the annual changes varied among different sub-regions. The SOC storage of grasslands in 2012 increased by 0.51x10(12) kg C compared to that in 2000. The average carbon sequestration rate was 0.04x10(12) kg C/a. The slope of the values of SOC storage showed that SOC storage exhibited an overall increase since 2000, particularly for the grasslands of Hulun Buir city and Xilin Gol League, where the typical grassland type was mainly distributed. Taking the SOC storage under the best grassland quality between 2000 and 2012 as a reference, this study predicted that the SOC potential of grasslands in central and eastern Inner Mongolia in 2012 is 1.38x10(12) kg C. This study will contribute to researches on related methods and fundamental database, as well as provide a reference for the protection of grassland ecosystems and the formulation of local policies on sustainable grassland development.";"0";"WOS:000373138300005";2016;"soc, grassland, stock, cropland, china";0.911369630745549;257

We evaluated the effects of agricultural management systems on soil organic C (SOC) stocks in the Brazilian states of Rondonia and Mato Grosso, and derived regional specific factors for soil C stock change associated with different management systems. We used 50 observations (data points) in this study, including 42 dealing with annual cropping practices and 8 dealing with perennial cropping, and analyzed the data in linear mixed-effect models. No tillage (NT) systems in Cerrado areas increased SOC Storage by 1.08 +/- 0.06 relative to SOC stocks under native conditions, while SOC storage increased by a modest factor of 1.01 +/- 0.17 in Cerradao and Amazon Forest conditions.
   Full tillage (FT) had negative effect on SOC storage relative to NT, decreasing SOC stocks by a factor of 0.94 +/- 0.04. but did not significantly reduce SOC stocks relative to native levels when adopted in the Cerrado region. Perennial cropping had a minimal impact on SOC stocks, estimated at a factor Value of 0.98 +/- 0.14, suggesting these systems maintain about 98% of the SOC stock found under native vegetation.

Estimates of topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) pool may be crucial for understanding soil C dynamics under human land uses and soil potential of mitigating the increasing atmospheric CO2 by soil C sequestration. China is a country with long history of cultivation. In this paper, we present an estimate of topsoil SOC pool and cultivation-induced pool reduction of China soils based upon the data of all the soil types identified in the 2nd national soil survey conducted during 1979-1982. The area of cultivated soils of China amounted to 138x10(6) ha while the uncultivated soils occupied 740x10(6) ha in 1980. Topsoil SOC density ranged from 0.77 to 1489 t Cha(-1) in uncultivated soils and 3.52 to 591 t Cha(-1) in cultivated soils with the average being 50 +/- 47 t Cha(-1) and 35 +/- 32 t Cha(-1), respectively. Geographically, the maximum mean topsoil SOC density was found in northeastern China, being of 70 +/- 104 t Cha(-1) for uncultivated soils and of 57 +/- 54 t Cha(-1) for cultivated soils, respectively. The lowest topsoil SOC density for uncultivated soils was found in East China, being of 38 +/- 33 t Cha(-1) and that for cultivated soils in North China, being of 30 +/- 30 t Cha(-1). There is still uncertainty in estimating the total topsoil SOC of uncultivated soils because a large portion of them was not surveyed during the 2nd Soil Survey. However, an estimate of total SOC for cultivated soils amounted to 5.1 Pg. On average, cultivation of China's soils had induced a decrease of SOC density of 15 t Cha(-1) giving rise to an overall pool reduction at 2 Pg. This is significantly smaller than the total SOC pool decline of 7 Pg due to cultivation of natural soils in China reported by Wu et al. (Glob. Change Biol. 2003, 9: 305-315), who made a pool estimation of whole soil profile assuming 1 m depth for all soils. As the mean topsoil SOC density of China was lower than the world average value given by Batjes (J. Soil Sci. 1996, 47: 151-163), China may be considered as a country with low SOC density and may have great potential for C sequestration under well defined management. However, the dynamics of topsoil C storage in China agricultural soils since 1980's and the effects of modern agricultural developments on C dynamics need further study for elucidating the role of China agriculture in global climatic change.";"63";"WOS:000231877900004";2005;"soc, grassland, stock, cropland, china";0.908803221688163;257
"The priming potential of biochar products in relation to labile carbon
   contents and soil organic matter status";"Cross, A
   Sohi, SP";"Recognition of biochar as a potential tool for long-term carbon sequestration with additional agronomic benefits is growing. However, the functionality of biochar in soil and the response of soils to biochar inputs are poorly understood. It has been suggested, for example, that biochar additions to soils could prime for the loss of native organic carbon, undermining its sequestration potential. This work examines the priming potential of biochar in the context of its own labile fraction and procedures for their assessment. A systematic set of biochar samples produced from C4 plant biomass under a range of pyrolysis process conditions were incubated in a C3 soil at three discrete levels of organic matter status (a result of contrasting long-term land management on a single site). The biochar samples were characterised for labile carbon content ex-situ and then added to each soil. Priming potential was determined by a comparison of CO(2) flux rates and its isotopic analysis for attribution of source. The results conclusively showed that while carbon mineralisation was often higher in biochar amended soil, this was due to rapid utilisation of a small labile component of biochar and that biochar did not prime for the loss of native organic soil organic matter. Furthermore, in some cases negative priming occurred, with lower carbon mineralisation in biochar amended soil, probably as a result of the stabilisation of labile soil carbon. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The High Plains, USA, lacks region-wide SOC estimates within playa wetlands and their adjacent watershed. Croplands often have less SOC than grasslands, and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP; former croplands planted to grass) may return SOC. Our goals were to estimate SOC within playa wetlands and investigate small scale differences within wetland catchments across a broad agriculturally modified landscape. We estimated SOC (kg m(-2)) to 50 cm depth from 4 soil cores/catchment (in playas and 10,40 and 100 m into uplands) at 56, 52, and 54 sites in native grassland, CRP and cropland, respectively. At a subset of sample locations within each land use type, we estimated SOC to 1 m depth to characterize SOC missed by shallow sampling. In playa wetlands, CRP SOC from 0 to 50 cm was 18% greater than croplands, but native grassland playa SOC did not differ from other land-uses. From 0 to 1 m, SOC in native grassland wetlands and uplands was 20% greater than the same habitats within croplands, while CRP lands were intermediate. Native grassland playa SOC also was 16% greater than in surrounding native short grass prairie. Playas therefore represent an important SOC repository in the High Plains ecoregion. CRP playas and uplands may require an additional 10-30 years to resemble native grassland SOC. SOC increased with playa area throughout CRP and native grassland catchments, suggesting playa hydrogeomorphology influences adjacent upland SOC. High Plains playas store 20.8 Tg C and cropland conversion caused a cumulative loss of 2.0 Tg C from 82,000 ha of playas. Currently, CRP enrollment on over 25,000 ha of playas has returned 0.2 Tg C (95% CI: 0.1-0.3), only half the historic SOC lost by cropland conversion within CRP playas. To promote SOC storage, native grasslands and large playas should be preserved and CRP enrollments should be maintained over long timescales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Hurricanes, such as Katrina and Rita, have triggered instantaneous large carbon losses of sequestered soil carbon through the destruction of large areas of marsh. This analysis shows proposed coastal restoration efforts will not be sufficient to restore carbon losses by storms and marsh deterioration. Further, we have estimated the economic benefit of carbon sequestration for coastal wetland restoration efforts. Results show that LA coastal marshes may not serve as a net sink of carbon.

Eleven specific management regimes were distinguished, based on legal status, management activities and aquaculture indicators. We assessed and verified matching ecological characteristics per regime. We identified key ecosystem properties underpinning service provision and 'state' and 'performance' indicators for seven ecosystem services: food, raw materials, coastal protection, carbon sequestration, water purification, nursery and nature-based recreation. Service provision was estimated and scored for each regime by relating their ecological characteristics with ecosystem service indicators. Natural mangroves scored highest for most services, except for food. High food production in aquaculture occurs at the expense of other services. Transitions between management regimes were illustrated to show consequences of management decisions. This study shows the merits of quantifying multifunctionality of management regimes in mangrove systems.

Agronomic benefits of biochar application are critically highlighted because researches show that biochar had varied effects on crop productivity thorough the different bio-physical interactions between the biochar and the soils, which are deserved for further investigations. Potential pitfalls and knowledge gaps were briefly discussed on the environmental behavior and the effects of biochar in agricultural ecosystem.";"37";"WOS:000310069200011";2012;"biochar, amend, pyrolysi, feedstock, incub";0.877664795021075;360
"Growth, productivity, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration of
   pure and mixed native tree plantations in the Caribbean lowlands of
   Costa Rica";"Redondo-Brenes, A
   Montagnini, F";"In Costa Rica, reforestation programs with indigenous tree species are a recent activity. Information is still scarce on long-term species performance and silvicultural management to ensure the success of tree plantings, especially for mixed stands. This study aims to estimate growth, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration of nine native tree species growing in mixed and pure plantings. The study was carried out at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. More than a half of the tree species studied (e.g. Calophyllum brasiliense, Jacaranda copaia, Terminalia amazonia, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Vochysiaferruginea, Balizia elegans) are distributed from Mexico-Guatemala to South America and a few have more limited distribution in Central America (e.g. Vochysia guatemalensis, Virola koschnyi, Dipteryx panamensis). The nine tree species are divided into three sets. The 3 members of each set were grown separately in pure plantations, and together in I mixed plantation, giving 12 monocultures and 4 mixtures. Plantation 1 (13 years old) is composed of V guatemalensis, C. brasiliense, and J. copaia. Plantation 2 (13 years old) is comprised of D. panamensis, T amazonia and V koschnyi. Plantation 3 (12 years old) is composed of H. alchorneoides, B. elegans, and V. ferruginea. Overall, all the species had good growth and productivity either in pure or mixed stands in comparison to other native and exotic species growing in similar ecological conditions. The exception was C. brasiliense in mixed stands, where it was suppressed by the fast-growing species V guatemalensis and J. copaia. At the stand level, the mixed stands performed well for volume, basal area, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration, in comparison to other pure or mixed plantations of tropical timber species. Pure plantations of V guatemalensis, V ferruginea, V koschnyi, J. copaia, and T amazonia also presented good productivity. At the tree level, V guatemalensis, J. copaia, T amazonia, H. alchorneoides, and D. panamensis performed better in mixtures than in pure stands for diameter, height, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration estimations. Values for the former three species were significantly higher in mixed than in pure stands. C. brasiliense was the only species with significantly better growth in pure stands than in mixed stands, for the three-species combination examined. The results show that mixed plantings had similar or higher productivities for several of the variables examined, but conclusions, on relative productivities depend on the species and growth features, interactions among species, and the variables quantified. In addition, there is a need to continue monitoring over longer time-frames, and for further studies of the species interactions and site factors involved, in order to develop reforestation guidelines for a range of objectives and environmental settings.

"Managing carbon in a multiple use world: The implications of land-use
   decision context for carbon management";"Dilling, L
   Failey, E";"Human land use contributes significantly to the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Changes in land management practices have been proposed as a critical and cost-effective mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the storage of additional carbon in vegetation and soils. However many discussions of the potential for land use to mitigate climate change only take into account biophysical factors such as vegetation and land cover and neglect how the agency of land owners themselves affects whether additional carbon storage can be achieved. Unlike many potential REDD opportunities in developing countries, land management in the U.S. to enhance carbon sequestration would occur against a backdrop of clearly defined, legally enforceable land ownership. In addition, more than a third of the land surface in the U.S. is managed by federal agencies who operate under legal guidelines for multiple use and is subject to demands from multiple constituencies. We set out to investigate how the goal of enhancing carbon sequestration through land use is perceived or implemented in one region of the U.S., and how this goal might intersect the existing drivers and incentives for public and private land use decision making. We conducted a case study through interviews of the major categories of landowners in the state of Colorado, which represents a mixture of public and privately held lands. By analyzing trends in interview responses across categories, we found that managing for carbon is currently a fairly low priority and we identify several barriers to more widespread consideration of carbon as a management priority including competing objectives, limited resources, lack of information, negative perceptions of offsetting and lack of a sufficient policy signal. We suggest four avenues for enhancing the potential for carbon to be managed through land use including clarifying mandates for public lands, providing compelling incentives for private landowners, improving understanding of the co-benefits and tradeoffs of managing for carbon, and creating more usable science to support decision making.

   Ollero, P";"In this study, a simplified methodology for the calculation of the balance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and corresponding saving compared with the fossil reference is presented. The proposed methodology allows the estimation of the anthropogenic GHG emissions of thermochemical biorefineries (net emitted to the atmosphere). In the calculation of the GHG balance, all relevant factors have been identified and analyzed including multiproduction, emissions from biogenic carbon capture and storage (Bio-CCS), co-feeding of fossil fuels (secondary feedstock) and possible carbon storage in biomass-derived products (chemicals). Therefore, it is possible to calculate the balance of GHG emissions of a hypothetical thermochemical biorefinery considering different alternatives of land-use, biomass feedstock, co-feeding of fossil fuels, Bio-CCS incorporation and final use of the products. The comparison of the estimated GHG balance with the corresponding fossil reference for each product is of special relevance in the methodology since it is the parameter used in European regulation for the fulfillment of sustainability criteria in biomass-derived fuels and liquids. The proposed methodology is tested using a previously assessed set of different process concepts of thermochemical biorefineries (techno-economic analysis). The resulting GHG balance and saving are analyzed to identify uncertainties and provide recommendations for future regulation. In all process concepts, the GHG savings are above the minimum requirement of GHG emissions for 2018. In the case of incorporating Bio-CCS, cradle-to-grave negative GHG emissions are obtained. However, in order to assess the role of chemical co-production from biomass, they need to be included in future regulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Biochar Pyrolyzed at Two Temperatures Affects Escherichia coli Transport
   through a Sandy Soil";"Bolster, CH
   Abit, SM";"The incorporation of biochar into soils has been proposed as a means to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. An added environmental benefit is that biochar has also been shown to increase soil retention of nutrients, heavy metals, and pesticides. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether biochar amendments affect the transport of Escherichia coli through a water-saturated soil. We looked at the transport of three E. coli isolates through 10-cm columns packed with a fine sandy soil amended with 2 or 10% (w/w) poultry litter biochar pyrolyzed at 350 or 700 degrees C. For all three isolates, mixing the high-temperature biochar at a rate of 2% into the soil had no impact on transport behavior. When added at a rate of 10%, a reduction of five orders of magnitude in the amount of E. coli transported through the soil was observed for two of the isolates, and a 60% reduction was observed for the third isolate. Mixing the low-temperature biochar into the soil resulted in enhanced transport through the soil for two of the isolates, whereas no significant differences in transport behavior were observed between the low-temperature and high-temperature biochar amendments for one isolate. Our results show that the addition of biochar can affect the retention and transport behavior of E. coli and that biochar application rate, biochar pyrolysis temperature, and bacterial surface characteristics were important factors determining the transport of E. coli through our test soil.";"13";"WOS:000299213900014";2012;"biochar, amend, pyrolysi, feedstock, incub";0.869420030014402;360

   Li, KR";"The planted forest area and carbon sequestration have increased significantly in China, because of large-scale reforestation and afforestation in the past decades. In this study, we developed an age-based volume-to-biomass method to estimate the carbon storage by planted forests in China in the period of 1973-2003 based on the data from 1209 field plots and national forest inventories. The results show that the total carbon storage of planted forests was 0.7743 Pg C in 1999-2003, increased by 3.08 times since the early 1970s. The carbon density of planted forests varied from 10.6594 Mg/ha to 23.9760 Mg/ha and increased by 13.3166 Mg/ha from 1973-1976 to 1999-2003. Since the early 1970s, the planted forests in China have been always a carbon sink, and the annual rate of carbon sequestration was 0.0217 Pg C/yr. The carbon storage and densities of planted forests varied greatly in space and time. The carbon storage of Middle South China was in the lead in all regions, which accounted for 23%-36% of national carbon storage. While higher C densities (from 17.79 Mg/ha to 26.05 Mg/ha) were usually found in Northeast China. The planted forests in China potentially have a high carbon sequestration since a large part of them are becoming mature and afforestation continues to grow.";"5";"WOS:000279814200001";2010;"forest, reforest, china, tropic, deforest";0.869411414749595;225

   Basso, B";"Soil organic carbon sequestration rates over 20 years based on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) methodology were combined with local economic data to determine the potential for soil C sequestration in wheat-based production systems on the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). The C sequestration potential of rice-wheat systems of India on conversion to no-tillage is estimated to be 44.1 Mt C over 20 years. Implementing no-tillage practices in maize-wheat and cotton-wheat production systems would yield an additional 6.6 Mt C. This offset is equivalent to 9.6% of India's annual greenhouse gas emissions (519 Mt C) from all sectors (excluding land use change and forestry), or less than one percent per annum. The economic analysis was summarized as carbon supply curves expressing the total additional C accumulated over 20 year for a price per tonne of carbon sequestered ranging from zero to USD 200. At a carbon price of USD 25 Mg C-1, 3 Mt C (7% of the soil C sequestration potential) could be sequestered over 20 years through the implementation of no-till cropping practices in rice-wheat systems of the Indian States of the IGP, increasing to 7.3 Mt C (17% of the soil C sequestration potential) at USD 50 Mg C-1. Maximum levels of sequestration could be attained with carbon prices approaching USD 200 Mg C-1 for the States of Bihar and Punjab. At this carbon price, a total of 34.7 Mt C (79% of the estimated C sequestration potential) could be sequestered over 20 years across the rice-wheat region of India, with Uttar Pradesh contributing 13.9 Mt C.

"Carbon Recycling for Renewable Materials and Energy Supply Recent
   Trends, Long-Term Options, and Challenges for Research and Development";"Bringezu, S";"The current flow of carbon for the production, use, and waste management of polymer-based products is still mostly linear from the lithosphere to the atmosphere with rather low rates of material recycling. In view of a limited future supply of biomass, this article outlines the options to further develop carbon recycling (C-REC). The focus is on carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and use for synthesis of platform chemicals to produce polymers. CO2 may be captured from exhaust gases after combustion or fermentation of waste in order to establish a C-REC system within the technosphere. As a long-term option, an external C-REC system can be developed by capturing atmospheric CO2. A central role may be expected from renewable methane (or synthetic natural gas), which is increasingly being used for storage and transport of energy, but may also be used for renewable carbon supply for chemistry. The energy input for the C-REC processes can come from wind and solar systems, in particular, power for the production of hydrogen, which is combined with CO2 to produce various hydrocarbons. Most of the technological components for the system already exist, and, first modules for renewable fuel and polymer production systems are underway in Germany. This article outlines how the system may further develop over the medium to long term, from a piggy-back add-on flow system toward a self-carrying recycling system, which has the potential to provide the material and energy backbone of future societies. A critical bottleneck seems to be the capacity and costs of renewable energy supply, rather than the costs of carbon capture.";"7";"WOS:000337595300003";2014;"energi, technolog, captur, ccs, power";0.868659636742219;249

   Zhou, DM";"Land application of biochar is increasingly being considered for potential agronomic and environmental benefits, e.g., enhancing carbon sequestration, nutrient retention, water holding capacity, and crop productivity; and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and bioavailability of environmental contaminants. However, little is known about the transport of biochar particles in the aqueous environment, which represents a critical knowledge gap because biochar particles can facilitate the transport of adsorbed contaminants. In this study, column experiments were conducted to investigate biochar particle transport and retention in water-saturated quartz sand. Specific factors considered included biochar feedstocks (wheat straw and pine needle), pyrolysis temperature (350 and 550 degrees C), and particle size (micrometer-particle (MP) and nanoparticle (NP)). Greater mobility was observed for the biochars of lower pyrolysis temperatures and smaller particle sizes. Extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) calculations that considered measured zeta potentials and Lewis acid base interactions were used to better understand the influence of pyrolysis temperature on biochars particle transport. Most biochars exhibited attractive acid base interactions that impeded their transport, whereas the biodiar with the greatest mobility had repulsive acid base interaction. Nonetheless, greater retention of the MPs than that of the NPs was in contrast with the XDLVO predictions. Straining and biochar surface charge heterogeneity were found to enhance the retention of biochar MPs, but played an insignificant role in the biochar NP retention. Experimental breakthrough curves and retention profiles were well-described using a two-site kinetic retention model that accounted for depth-dependent retention at one site. Modeled first-order retention coefficients on both sites 1 and 2 increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature and particle size.";"45";"WOS:000313667400021";2013;"biochar, amend, pyrolysi, feedstock, incub";0.861854981587662;360

   Bending, G";"There is considerable current interest in using biochar (BC) as a soil amendment to sequester carbon to mitigate climate change. However, the implications of adding BC to agricultural soil for the environmental fate of pesticides remain unclear. In particular, the effect of biochars on desorption behavior of compounds is poorly understood. This study examined the influence of BC on pesticide chemical and biological accessibility using the herbicide isoproturon (IPU). Soils amended with 1% and 2% BC showed enhanced sorption, slower desorption, and reduced biodegradation of IPU. Addition of 0.1% BC had no effect on sorption, desorption or biodegradation of IPU. However, the mineralization of C-14-IPU was reduced by all BC concentrations, reducing by 13.6%, 40.1% and 49.8% at BC concentrations of 0.1%, 1% and 2% respectively. Further, the ratio of the toxic metabolite 4-isopropyl-aniline to intact IPU was substantially reduced by higher BC concentrations. Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) extractions were used to estimate the IPU bioaccessibility in the BC-amended soil. Significant correlations were found between HPCD-extracted C-14-IPU and the IPU desorbed (%) (r(2) = 0.8518, p < 0.01), and also the C-14-IPU mineralized (%) (r(2) = 0.733; p < 0.01) for all BC-amended soils. This study clearly demonstrates how desorption in the presence of BC is intimately related to pesticide biodegradation by the indigenous soil microbiota. BC application to agricultural soils can affect the persistence of pesticides as well as the fate of their degradation products. This has important implications for the effectiveness of pesticides as well as the sequestration of contaminants in soils. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   Owende, P";"Due to a lack of indigenous fossil energy resources, Ireland's energy supply constantly teeters on the brink of political, geopolitical, and geographical unease. The potential risk to the security of the energy supply combined with the contribution of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to climate change gives a clear indication of Ireland's need to reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels as primary energy source. A feasibility analysis to investigate the available renewable energy options was conducted using HOMER software. The net present cost, the cost of energy, and the CO2 emissions of each potential energy combination were considered in determining the most suitable renewable and non-renewable hybrid energy system. Wind energy was shown to have the greatest potential for renewable energy generation in Ireland: wind energy was a component of the majority of the optimal hybrid systems both in stand-alone and grid-connected systems. In 2010 the contribution of wind energy to gross electricity consumption in Ireland approximated 10%, and the results of this feasibility study indicate that there is great potential for wind-generated energy production in Ireland. Due to the inherent variability of wind energy the grid-connected system results are particularly relevant, which show that in more than half of the analyses investigating electrical energy demand the incorporation of wind energy offset the CO2 emissions of the non-renewable elements to such a degree that the whole system had negative CO2 emissions, which has serious implications for Kyoto Protocol emissions limits. Ireland also has significant potential for hydropower generation despite only accounting for 2% of the gross electricity consumption in 2010. Wind and hydro energy should therefore be thoroughly explored to secure an indigenous primary energy source in Ireland. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In most applications, crop productivity is significantly increased after agricultural soils are amended with biochar. In addition to increasing soil quality, the biochar amendments sequester carbon within the soil. However, the long-term effects of amending agricultural soils with biochar are difficult to predict, because the mechanisms behind the increase in productivity of biochar amended soils are not yet fully understood. Long-term detrimental effects on soil and the environment can occur if biochar is applied haphazardly. Current knowledge and the additional experimental work required to thoroughly understand the influence of biochar amendment on the behavior of agricultural soils processes are reviewed.

Sediments of replicate seagrass meadows representing different age treatments (as time since seeding: 0, 4, and 10 years), were analyzed for % carbon, % nitrogen, bulk density, organic matter content, and Pb-210 for dating at 1-cm increments to a depth of 10 cm. Sediment nutrient and organic content, and carbon accumulation rates were higher in 10-year seagrass meadows relative to 4-year and bare sediment. These differences were consistent with higher shoot density in the older meadow. Carbon accumulation rates determined for the 10-year restored seagrass meadows were 36.68 g C m(-2) yr(-1).

   Nieder, R";"Subsoils play an important role within the global C cycle, since they have high soil organic carbon (SOC) storage capacity due to generally low SOC concentrations. However, measures for enhancing SOC storage commonly focus on topsoils. This study assessed the long-term storage and stability of SOC in topsoils buried in arable subsoils by deep ploughing, a globally applied method for breaking up hard pans and improving soil structure to optimize crop growing conditions. One effect of deep ploughing is translocation of SOC formed near the surface into the subsoil, with concomitant mixing of SOC-poor subsoil material into the new' topsoil. Deep-ploughed croplands represent unique long-term insitu incubations of SOC-rich material in subsoils. In this study, we sampled five loamy and five sandy soils that were ploughed to 55-90cm depth 35-50years ago. Adjacent, similarly managed but conventionally ploughed subplots were sampled as reference. The deep-ploughed soils contained on average 42 +/- 13% more SOC than the reference subplots. On average, 45years after deep ploughing, the new' topsoil still contained 15% less SOC than the reference topsoil, indicating long-term SOC accumulation potential in the topsoil. In vitro incubation experiments on the buried sandy soils revealed 63 +/- 6% lower potential SOC mineralisation rates and also 67 +/- 2% lower SOC mineralisation per unit SOC in the buried topsoils than in the reference topsoils. Wider C/N ratio in the buried sandy topsoils than in the reference topsoils indicates that deep ploughing preserved SOC. The SOC mineralisation per unit SOC in the buried loamy topsoils was not significantly different from that in the reference topsoils. However, 56 +/- 4% of the initial SOC was preserved in the buried topsoils. It can be concluded that deep ploughing contributes to SOC sequestration by enlarging the storage space for SOC-rich material.";"0";"WOS:000380016800024";2016;"soc, grassland, stock, cropland, china";0.837165866233695;257

   multispectral remote sensing";"Wicaksono, P

   Nehren, U";"Among vegetated coastal habitats, mangrove forests are among the densest carbon pools. They store their organic carbon in the surrounding soil and thus the sequestered carbon stays in the sediment for a long time and cannot be easily returned to the atmosphere. Additionally, mangroves also provide various important ecosystem services in coastal areas and surroundings. Accordingly, it is important to understand the distribution of biomass carbon stock in mangrove habitats in a spatial and temporal context, not only to reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, but also for their sustainability. The objectives of this research are to map the mangrove carbon stock and estimate the total biomass carbon stock sheltered by mangrove forests, with the Karimunjawa Islands as a study site, using the widely available passive remote sensing system ALOS AVNIR-2. The modelling and mapping of mangrove carbon stock incorporates the integration of image pixel values and mangroves field data via empirical modelling. Vegetation indices and PC bands at different levels of radiometric corrections were all used as the input in the mangrove carbon stock modelling so that the effectiveness and sensitivity of different image transformations to particular radiometric correction levels could be analysed and understood. Afterward, the accuracy and effectiveness of each mangrove carbon stock-mapping routine was compared and evaluated. The accuracy of the best mangrove above-ground carbon stock (AGC) map modelled from vegetation index is 77.1% (EVI1, SE 5.89 kg C m(-2)), and for mangrove below-ground carbon stock (BGC) it is 60.0% (GEMI, SE 2.54 kg C m(-2)). The mangrove carbon stock map from ALOS AVNIR-2 PC bands showed a maximum accuracy of 77.8% (PC2, SE 5.71 kg C m(-2)) and 60.8% (PC2, SE 2.48 kg C m(-2)) for AGC and BGC respectively. From the resulting maps, the Karimunjawa Islands are estimated to shelter 96,482 tonnes C of mangroves AGC with a mean value of 21.64 kg C m(-2) and 24,064 tonnes C of mangroves BGC with a mean value of 5.39 kg C m(-2). Potentially, there are approximately 120,546 tonnes C of mangrove biomass carbon stock in the Karimunjawa Islands. Remote-sensing reflectance can successfully model mangrove carbon stock based on the relationship between mangrove canopy properties, represented by leaf area index (LAI) and the tree or root biomass carbon stock. The accuracy of the mangrove carbon stock map is subject to errors, which are sourced mainly from: (1) the absence of a species-specific biomass allometric equation for several species present in the study area; (2) the generalized standard conversion value of mangrove biomass to mangrove carbon stock; (3) the relationship between mangrove reflectance and mangrove LAI; (4) the relationship between mangrove reflectance and above-ground mangrove biomass and carbon stock due to its relationship with LAI; (5) the relationship between mangrove LAI and mangrove below-ground parts; (6) the inability to perform mangrove carbon stock modelling at the species level due to the complexities of the mangrove forest in the study area; (7) background reflectance and atmospheric path radiance that could not be completely minimized using image radiometric corrections and transformations; and (8) spatial displacement between the actual location of the mangrove forest in the field and the corresponding pixel in the image.
   The availability of mangrove biomass carbon stock maps is beneficial for carrying out various management activities, and is also very important for the resilience of mangroves to changing environments.";"1";"WOS:000367156000003";2016;"servic, restor, mangrov, coastal, habitat";0.83656523287725;133

Variation of SOC is controlled by environmental factors such as land use and topography. Toshan watershed located in northern Iran was selected to study the effects of different land uses i.e. forest (FO), cropland (CP), orchard (OR) and abandoned land (AB) on different slope gradients and aspects on SOC both in surface (0-30 cm) and subsurface (30-100 cm) layers. A total of 364 soil samples plus 1638 undisturbed ones were collected from two soil layers in 182 sampling sites. Results showed that the surface 30 cm soil layer was solely responsible for 54.8% of SOC density. On average, FO with 22.84 kg m(-2) had the highest SOC density in 0-100 cm layer. Deforestation and agricultural activities have resulted in a significant 48.2% decrease of SOC density in 0-30 cm soil layer. North facing slope (N) aspect and also flat area of all land uses had the higher SOC density compared to east (E) and west facing slope (W) aspects in this subhumid region in 0-100 cm layer. Generally, in the upper 100 cm soil layer of deforested lands, gentle and moderate slopes had higher SOC density than steeper slopes. There was a positive significant correlation between SOC density and clay content. The largest amount of SOC storage was observed in the surface 30 cm layer accounting for 74,907.94 Mg (54.4% of total SOC storage), indicating the important key role of topsoil in conserving SOC. FO with one-third proportion of the total area stored the largest amount of SOC (39,325.55 Mg; 52.5%) in surface layer. In conclusion, protection of forest lands is higher important to increase SOC storage. Agricultural activities on steep E and W aspects in deforested lands must be reduced or prohibited. The subsoil has almost the same contribution to SOC storage and therefore should be carefully considered for management measures. Generally, interaction between environmental factors on storing SOC and also rate of carbon loss to the atmosphere was significant. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Biochar is being promoted as a soil amendment to enhance soil quality, it is also seen as a mechanism of long-term sequestration of carbon. Our experiments tested the hypothesis that biochar is inert in soil. However, we measured an increase in CO(2) production from soils after biochar amendment which increased with increasing rates of biochar. The partial derivative(13)C signature of the CO(2) evolved in the first several days of the incubation was the same as the partial derivative(13)C signature of the biochar, confirming that biochar contributed to the CO(2) flux. This effect diminished by day 6 of the incubation suggesting that most of the biochar C is slowly decomposing. Thus, aside from this short-term mineralization increasing soil C with young biochar may indeed be a long-term C storage mechanism.

   Dieperink, C";"Afforestation is considered an important option for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, plantation projects have been suggested for inclusion under the Clean Development Mechanism. While considered a cheap option, significant uncertainties make it difficult to determine the (net) carbon benefits and profitability of forestry projects. The current uncertainties about the regulatory framework of the CDM and the environmental and economic performance of plantation forestry could create uncertainties with respect to the additionality of such projects and thus their acceptance under the mechanism. Six plantation forestry projects that were proposed in Brazil have been used as cases to study sources of uncertainty for carbon benefits and economics for such projects. These cases vary widely in terms of productivity and products delivered. A quantitative model for calculating greenhouse gas balances and financial benefits and costs, taking a broad range of variables into account, was developed. Data from the developers of the proposed projects was used as main source material. Subsequently, scenario's were evaluated, containing different and realistic options for baseline vegetation, carbon crediting systems and CDM modalities, fluctuations in product prices, discount rates and carbon prices. The real cost of combined carbon sequestration and substitution for the case projects was below $3 per ton of carbon avoided, when based exclusively on data supplied by project developers. However, potential variations in carbon impact and costs based on scenario options were very large. Different baseline vegetation or adopting a different discount rate cause carbon credits to vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Different carbon crediting systems or fluctuations in (commodity) product prices cause variations up to 200% in carbon credits and NPV. This makes the additionality of such projects difficult to determine. Five of the six case projects seem uneligible for development under the CDM. A critical attitude towards the use of plantation projects under the CDM seems justified.";"12";"WOS:000186272100008";2003;"scenario, project, cost, price, forestri";0.828810849520227;158

We compare heat, power, and CO2 balances of systems with alternative configurations of the CHP and CO2-capture systems. Because the captured CO2 comes from renewable biomass, the studied systems yield negative CO2 emissions. It is shown that pulp mills and integrated pulp and paper mills have the potential to become net exporters of biomass-based electricity while at the same time removing CO2 from the atmosphere on a net basis. The study shows that that the overall best CO2 abatement is achieved when CO2 capture is carried out within a biomass integrated gasifier with combined cycle where the syngas undergoes a CO-shift reaction. This configuration combines efficient energy conversion with a high CO2 capture efficiency. Furthermore, cost curves are constructed, which show how the cost of CO2 capture and storage in pulp and paper mills depends on system configuration and the CO2 transportation distance.

   intercropping system in sub-Saharan Africa: results from re-examining a
   study";"Kim, DG";"Nitrogen (N)-fixing tree and crop intercropping systems can be a sustainable agricultural practice in sub-Saharan Africa and can also contribute to resolving climate change through enhancing soil carbon (C) sequestration. A study conducted by Makumba et al. (Agric Ecosyst Environ 118:237-243, 2007) on the N-fixing tree gliricidia and maize intercropping system in southern Malawi provides a rare dataset of both sequestered soil C and C loss as soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, no soil C gain and loss estimates were made so the study failed to show the net gain of soil C. Also absent from this study was potential benefit or negative impact related to the other greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from the intercropping system. Using the data provided in Makumba et al. (Agric Ecosyst Environ 118:237-243, 2007) a C loss as soil CO2 emissions (51.2 +/- A 0.4 Mg C ha(-1)) was estimated, amounting to 67.4% of the sequestered soil C (76 +/- A 8.6 Mg C ha(-1) in 0-2 m soil depth) for the first 7 years in the intercropping system. An annual net gain of soil C of 3.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) was estimated from soil C sequestered and lost. Inclusion of the potential for N2O mitigation [0.12-1.97 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1), 0.036-0.59 Mg CO2 equivalents (eq.) ha(-1) year(-1)] within this intercropping system mitigation as CO2 eq. basis was estimated to be 3.5-4.1 Mg CO2 eq. ha(-1) year(-1). These results suggest that reducing N2O emission can significantly increase the overall mitigation benefit from the intercropping system. However, significant uncertainties are associated with estimating the effect of intercropping on soil N2O and CH4 emissions. These results stress the importance of including consideration of quantifying soil CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions when quantifying the C sequestration potential in intercropping system.";"6";"WOS:000309670200006";2012;"ha1, n2o, yr1, pastur, flux";0.82107010373902;104

Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes.

By the mid-1970s, forest carbon decreased by 0.62 Pg C (Pg = 10(15) g), with a decreasing rate of 0.024 Pg C per year. Since then the biomass carbon showed a significant increase, from 4.38 Pg C by the end of 1970s to 4.75 Pg C by 1998, with an increasing rate of 0.022 Pg C per year, due mainly to the increased reforestation and afforestation. During the last two decades, planted forests have sequestered 0.45 Pg of carbon, with an annual rate of 0.021 Pg C. The average carbon density of plantations showed a significant increase from 15.3 Mg/hm(2) in the mid-1970 to 31.1 Mg/hm(2) in 1998, suggesting that the rising global temperature and CO2 fertilization may enhance this increasing uptake as well as expansion of planted forests.";"57";"WOS:000171380800014";2001;"forest, reforest, china, tropic, deforest";0.819699297483142;225

Our objectives were (1) to quantify the dependency of SOC stocks on vegetation type; (2) to identify in which aggregate sizes and chemical forms the SOC was stored; and (3) to determine which vegetation type was the most effective at sequestering SOC. Methods The studied vegetation types were shrubland CK16 (16-year-old Caragana korshinskii Kom.), shrubland CK26 (26-year-old C. korshinskii Kom.), shrubland AS (Armeniaca sibirica Lam.), natural grassland and artificial pasture. We investigated SOC stocks and measured soil carbon, in < 0.25, 0.25-1, 1-2, 2-5 and 5-8 mm sized aggregates, and carbon fractions [humus (HS-C), humic acid (HA-C), fulvic acid (FA-C)] from CK shrublands, natural grassland and cropland. Results The SOC stocks were the greatest for CK shrublands and natural grassland. Compared with cropland, shrubland CK caused increases in > 2 mm sized aggregate C stocks. The 1-2, 2-5, 5-8 mm size aggregate C stocks were the highest in the natural grassland. HS-C was 1.4, 3.1, and 4.1 Mg ha(-1) greater in shrubland CK16, shrubland CK26, and natural grassland, respectively, than in cropland.

We collected and compiled a forest biomass dataset of China, a total of 5841 sites, based on forest inventory and literature search results. From the dataset we extracted 338 sites with forests aged over 80 years, a threshold for defining mature forest, to establish the mature forest biomass dataset. After analyzing the spatial pattern of the carbon density of Chinese mature forests and its controlling factors, we used carbon density of mature forests as the reference level, and conservatively estimated the CCC of the forests in China by interpolation methods of Regression Kriging, Inverse Distance Weighted and Partial Thin Plate Smoothing Spline. Combining with the sixth National Forest Resources Inventory, we also estimated the forest CSP. The results revealed positive relationships between carbon density of mature forests and temperature, precipitation and stand age, and the horizontal and elevational patterns of carbon density of mature forests can be well predicted by temperature and precipitation. The total CCC and CSP of the existing forests are 19.87 and 13.86 Pg C, respectively. Subtropical forests would have more CCC and CSP than other biomes. Consequently, relying on forests to uptake carbon by decreasing disturbance on forests would be an alternative approach for mitigating greenhouse gas concentration effects besides afforestation and reforestation.";"3";"WOS:000346187000010";2014;"forest, reforest, china, tropic, deforest";0.816169157015745;225

Seagrass ecosystems play a multi-functional role in human well-being, e. g. food through fisheries, control of erosion and protection against floods. Quantifying these services reveals their contributions to human well-being and helps justify seagrass conservation. There has been no comprehensive assessment as to whether seagrass ecosystem services are perceived to vary over the globe or amongst genera. Our study compiles the most complete list of ecosystem services provided by seagrasses so far, including bioregional-and genus-specific information from expert opinion and published studies. Several seagrass ecosystem services vary considerably in their (known) provision across genera and over the globe. Seagrasses genera are clearly not all equal with regard to the ecosystem services they provide. As seagrass genera are not evenly distributed over all bioregions, the presence of an ecosystem service sometimes depends on the genera present. Larger sized seagrass genera (e. g. Posidonia, Enhalus) are perceived to provide more substantial and a wider variety of ecosystem services than smaller species (e. g. Halophila, Lepilaena). Nevertheless, smaller species provide important services.

"Can 'negative net CO2 emissions' from decarbonised biogas-to-electricity
   contribute to solving Poland's carbon capture and sequestration
   dilemmas?";"Budzianowski, WM";"The article analyses to what extent 'negative net CO2 emissions' from decarbonised biogas-to-electricity can contribute to solving Poland's carbon capture and sequestration dilemmas. From the criteria-based evaluation of low-carbon power technologies it is found, that biogas-to-electricity is among technologies having increasing production potential in Poland. Therefore, in future biogas will be able to contribute to solving Poland's CCS dilemmas, because it offers carbon-neutral electricity. Moreover, by applying CCS into biogas-to-electricity the 'negative net CO2 emissions' can be achieved. The article examines three biogas-to-electricity technologies involving CO2 capture, i.e. biogas-to-biomethane, biogas-to-CHP and biogas-to-electricity via the ORFC cycle. It is emphasised that the ORFC cycle offers low-cost CO2 separation from a CO2-H-2 mixture, low O-2-intensity, and the opportunities for advanced mass and energy integration of involved processes. Besides, energy conversion calculations show that the ORFC cycle can offer comparable cycle efficiency with air- and oxy-combustion combined cycles. In regard to the design of biogas-based energy systems it is recommended to include (i) distributed production of biogas in order to avoid costs of long-distance transportation of high-moisture content biomass and (ii) centralised large-scale decarbonised biogas-to-electricity power plants since costs of pipeline transportation of gases are low but large-scale plants could benefit from increased energy and CCS efficiencies.

However, only a few studies have evaluated the effects conservation tillage on the net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) in a rice wheat cropping system. Therefore, a split-plot field experiment was performed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of tillage practices (i.e., conventional intensive tillage [CT] and NT) and straw returning methods (i.e., straw returning or removal of preceding crop) on the soil total organic carbon (TOC), GHG emissions, GWP, GHGI, and NEEB of sandy loam soil in a rice wheat cropping system in central China. Conservation tillage did not affect rice and wheat grain yields. Compared with CT and straw removal, NT and straw returning significantly increased the TOC of 0-5 cm soil layer by 2.9% and 7.8%, respectively. However, the TOC of 0-20 cm soil layer was not affected by tillage practices and straw returning methods. NT did not also affect the N2O emissions during the rice and wheat seasons; NT significantly decreased the annual CH4 emissions by 7.5% and the annual GWP by 7.8% compared with CT. Consequently, GHGI under NT was reduced by 8.1%. Similar to NT, straw returning did not affect N2O emissions during the rice and wheat seasons. Compared with straw removal, straw returning significantly increased annual CH4 emissions by 35.0%, annual GWP by 32.0%, and annual GHGI by 31.1%. Straw returning did not also affect NEEB; by contrast, NT significantly increased NEEB by 15.6%. NT without straw returning resulted in the lowest GWP, the lowest GHGI, and the highest NEEB among all treatments. This finding suggested that NT without straw returning may be applied as a sustainable technology to increase economic and environmental benefits. Nevertheless, environmentally straw returning methods should be considered in future studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Total forest vegetation carbon storage increased from 136.51 in 1978 to 229.31 Tg C in 2008, and the forest area increased from 855.27 x 10(4) to 1,148.66 x 10(4) ha, showing that the Fujian forests have a net vegetation carbon increase of 96.72 Tg C with an annual increase of 4.84 Tg C over the study period. Carbon storage varied with dominant forest species, forest age and forest ownership, suggesting that increases in vegetation carbon potentials can be achieved through selection of forest species and management of age structures. Implementation of afforestation and reforestation programs in Fujian Province over the past three decades has made a significant contribution to forest carbon storage.

"Reducing the CO2 emissions in Croatian cement industry";"Mikulcic, H
   Vujanovic, M
   Duic, N";"Cement industry is one of the largest carbon emitting industrial sectors. It is responsible for about 5% of anthropogenic CO2 in the world. Therefore, it is a relevant industrial sector for CO2 emission regulation strategies. Bearing in mind the importance of cement industry in Croatia, and because of the fact that Croatia will soon become an EU member state, the present paper analyses the potential to reduce CO2 emission in the Croatian cement industry. There are several measures that can reduce CO2 emissions from the cement manufacturing process: the use of waste heat as an alternative source of energy; CO2 capture and storage technologies; reduction of clinker to cement ratio; the use of alternative and biomass fuels; the use of alternative raw materials; an energy efficient combustion process. The most energy efficient technology for cement manufacturing today is the use of a rotary kiln together with a multi-stage pre-heater and a calciner. Since the use of cement calciners is a relatively new technology, further improvement of their operating conditions is still needed. This paper also highlights the results of research in the field of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations that are used for the investigation of process and combustion emissions. The above mentioned measures together with numerical investigations can reduce the effect of cement manufacturing in Croatia on the environment and can make it more competitive with cement manufacturers from the EU.

"Carbon sequestration in wetland soils of the northern Gulf of Mexico
   coastal region";"Hansen, VD
   Nestlerode, JA";"Coastal wetlands play an important but complex role in the global carbon cycle, contributing to the ecosystem service of greenhouse gas regulation through carbon sequestration. Although coastal wetlands occupy a small percent of the total US land area, their potential for carbon storage, especially in soils, often exceeds that of other terrestrial ecosystems. More than half of the coastal wetlands in the US are located in the northern Gulf of Mexico, yet these wetlands continue to be degraded at an alarming rate, resulting in a significant loss of stored carbon and reduction in capacity for carbon sequestration. We provide estimates of surface soil carbon densities for wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region, calculated from field measurements of bulk density and soil carbon content in the upper 10-15 cm of soil. We combined these estimates with soil accretion rates derived from the literature and wetland area estimates to calculate surface soil carbon pools and accumulation rates. Wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region potentially store 34-47 Mg C ha(-1) and could potentially accumulate 11,517 Gg C year(-1). These estimates provide important information that can be used to incorporate the value of wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region in future wetland management decisions related to global climate change. Estimates of carbon sequestration potential should be considered along with estimates of other ecosystem services provided by wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region to strengthen and enhance the conservation, sustainable management, and restoration of these important natural resources.";"10";"WOS:000335908600006";2014;"servic, restor, mangrov, coastal, habitat";0.802776572957268;133

Reforestation trials have demonstrated that edaphic conditions may have a strong effect on species growth and survival. However it is unclear how the relative importance of soil conditions influences species survival and growth under varying amounts of rainfall and lengths of dry season.
   Two-year growth and mortality of 49 tree species were evaluated in four sites across Panama, representing a soil fertility-rainfall matrix. Despite strong contrasts in environmental conditions, 65% of individual species did not show consistent differences in growth between high- and low-fertility sites or between wet and dry sites. However, early growth and survival were more strongly affected by soil fertility than by rainfall patterns for the second-largest group; 30% of the species grew significantly better in both high-fertility sites than in both low-fertility sites, compared to 6% in both wet sites vs. both dry sites. In the two high-fertility sites, growth of 47% and 69% of the species was better than their across-site means. On the other hand, 55% and 73% of the species grew significantly slower than their across-site averages in the two low-fertility sites.
   Survival did not appear to be associated to either soil fertility or rainfall. In each site, only a few species had a significantly higher or lower within-site survival than across-site survival.
   Diversifying the choice of tree species increases the options for reforestation strategies that match species characteristics to local site conditions and to the objectives and management possibilities of landholders. Testing the performance of potential species under different site conditions in screening trials is paramount, both to inform selection from among the vast diversity of tree species in the tropics that show good growth and survival under different local site conditions and to filter out unsuitable species and avoid early failure of the reforestation effort.

This investigation examines the effects of elevated soil CO2 concentrations from such emissions on vegetation biomass and microbial community biomass, respiration and carbon utilisation in temperate grassland. Soil CO2 concentrations was increased by release of concentrated CO2 gas from a point source 0.6 m below the surface of the soil as a low-level leak (1 l min(-1)) for 10 weeks. The gassing resulted in reduced vegetation above- and below-ground biomass over time. No significant changes in microbial biomass or carbon utilisation were observed, but a trend towards reduced microbial respiration was apparent. This research provides a first step towards understanding the potential ecological risks of geologic carbon storage, the development of biological leak detection methods, and improved understanding of the effects of elevated soil CO2 concentrations on biological communities.";"18";"WOS:000272383900017";2009;"communiti, microbi, dri, abund, group";0.800374012803515;89

The study investigated the importance of individual mitigation options such as energy intensity improvements, carbon capture and storage (CCS), nuclear power, solar and wind power and bioenergy for climate mitigation. Limiting the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration to 450 or 550 ppm CO2 equivalent by 2100 would require a decarbonization of the global energy system in the 21(st) century. Robust characteristics of the energy transformation are increased energy intensity improvements and the electrification of energy end use coupled with a fast decarbonization of the electricity sector. Non-electric energy end use is hardest to decarbonize, particularly in the transport sector. Technology is a key element of climate mitigation. Versatile technologies such as CCS and bioenergy are found to be most important, due in part to their combined ability to produce negative emissions. The importance of individual low-carbon electricity technologies is more limited due to the many alternatives in the sector. The scale of the energy transformation is larger for the 450 ppm than for the 550 ppm CO(2)e target. As a result, the achievability and the costs of the 450 ppm target are more sensitive to variations in technology availability.";"80";"WOS:000334414900002";2014;"energi, technolog, captur, ccs, power";0.798603146385213;249
"Effects of permanence requirements on afforestation choices for carbon
   sequestration for Ontario, Canada";"Yemshanov, D

   Lempriere, T";"This study examines the economic and spatial impacts of afforestation choices for carbon sequestration in Ontario, Canada when the non-permanence of forestry carbon offsets is taken into consideration. We test six scenarios including three long-term projects with red pine, Norway spruce and hybrid poplar plantations and three shorter term hybrid poplar scenarios that produce temporary carbon emission offsets. We convert the break-even costs of sequestering carbon to a permanent carbon offset equivalent and analyze the possible geographical implications of the choices across eastern, southern and central Ontario, Canada. The most financially viable scenarios show a relatively large part of central Ontario with attractive choices at a 4% discount rate but a much smaller area at an 8% rate. The assumption about the future price evolution of temporary carbon offsets is one of the biggest factors that influence the attractiveness of these choices. At the 4% discount rate and the assumption of rising prices of permanent carbon offsets, the scenarios that store carbon for long periods appear to be the least-costly option. Hybrid poplar appears as the best choice in southern Ontario and a mix of conifer species and hybrid poplar in the central and northern parts. When future prices of temporary carbon offsets are assumed to decline, temporary hybrid poplar projects appear to be more attractive in the southern and eastern parts of the province. The variety of alternative scenario choices also depends on the discount rate and future price expectations for temporary carbon offsets. For a relatively narrow deviation of the carbon offset price (+/-$0.6 t(-1) CO(2)), only 4% to 9.2% of the total 5.8 million ha area would have one or more potentially viable alternative scenarios at the 4% discount rate and almost zero alternatives at the 8% rate. Higher discount rates lead to fewer attractive choices, suggesting that landowners would be left with very few options when trying to maximize net returns from plantations.

This study analyzes the spatial and temporal changes in land use and forest cover patterns in a typical mountain forest area in the Torul State Forest Enterprise area of Northeastern Turkey. The investigation evaluates the temporal changes of the spatial structure of forest conditions through the spatial analysis of forest-cover type maps from 1984 and 2005 using GIS and FRAGSTATS. The evidence presented here showed that there were drastic changes in the temporal and spatial dynamics of land use/forest cover, and between 1984 and 2005 there was a net increase of 19.9% in total forested area. Productive forest area increased by 3161 ha, although degraded forest area increased 9216 ha. In examining the changes of crown closure and development stages of the forest ecosystem during the study period, the forest stand area with low crown closures increased. The regenerated area increased because of regeneration activities while the other development stages were left to grow to older development stages in the period. These results regarding the crown closure and development stage show that forest quality has increased, and this is partly due to emigration of the rural population in Torul. In terms of spatial configuration, the landscape structure in Torul, the State Forest Enterprise area, changed substantially over the 21-year study period, resulting in fragmentation of the landscape as indicated by large patch numbers and smaller mean patch sizes, owing to heavy timber subtraction, illegal cutting, and uncontrolled stand treatments.";"1";"WOS:000261766900005";2008;"forest, reforest, china, tropic, deforest";0.79508343981522;225

The net GWP and GHGI either including the carbon emissions from agricultural management (net mGWP/mGHGI) or not were estimated from an intensive vegetable production system in Nanjing, China between 2009 and 2010. The four typical consecutive rotations included celery-tung choy-baby bok choy-amaranth (C-T-Bb-A), choy sum-celery-tung choy-bok choy (Cs-C-T-Bc), garland chrysanthemum-tung choy-bok choy (G-T-Bc), and celery-choy sum-lettuce-bok choy (C-Cs-L-Bc). A net sink was observed and estimated at crop seasonal time scale for both the NECB and the soil organic carbon change (delta SOC) from the four vegetable rotation fields. The mGWP, net GWP, net mGWP. GHGI and mGHGI all showed nearly consistent changes among the rotations and among the vegetables within each rotation. The global warming potential ranged from 26 Mg CO2 equiv. ha(-1) to 109 Mg CO2 equiv. ha(-1) for net GWP and 36 Mg CO2 equiv. ha(-1) to 131 Mg CO2 equiv. ha(-1) for mGWP. The GHGI and mGHGI ranged from 0.17 kg CO2 equiv. kg(-1) vegetable to 0.41 kg CO2 equiv. kg(-1) vegetable and from 0.22 kg CO2 equiv.kg(-1) vegetable to 0.49 kg CO2 equiv. kg(-1) vegetable, respectively. The mGWP, net GWP, net mGWP, GHGI and mGHGI were dominated by the GWP resulting from N2O emissions. Annual cumulative direct N2O emissions were 374 kg N2O ha(-1) for G-T-Bc, 216 kg N2O ha(-1) for C-T-Bb-A, 159 kg N2O ha(-1) for Cs-C-T-Bc and 89 kg N2O ha(-1) for C-Cs-L-Bc, respectively. High N fertilizer input was likely responsible for the high N2O emissions. Increasing fertilizer use efficiency and adoption of best practices are effective measures for sustainable intensive vegetable production. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"COST AND PERFORMANCE OF CO2 STORAGE IN FORESTRY PROJECTS";"SWISHER, JN";"In order to include forestry projects in a possible CO2 emission reduction regime, and to compare the costs of individual projects or national programs, it is necessary to determine the rate of equivalency between carbon in fossil fuel emissions and carbon stored in different types of forestry projects. This paper presents a comprehensive and consistent methodology to account for the costs and carbon flows of different categories of forestry projects and describes the application of the methodology to a set of projects in Central America. Several estimates have been made to date of the overall potential for carbon storage through global reforestation and the costs of such efforts, based on global macroeconomic estimates and extrapolations from current forest-sector experience. However, there has yet to be a consistent analysis of the magnitude and cost of carbon savings by a \"bottom-up\" approach to sustainable forestry development This methodology is applied to a set of projects proposed in Costa Rica and other Central American countries under the Tropical Forest Action Plan, to estimate a sample set of national CO2 reduction cost curves. The costs of carbon savings in the forestry projects studied in Central America mostly fall between $5 and $13 ton-C1, depending on the type of project, the climate, and the opportunity cost of land. These projects also promise socio-economic benefits at the local level, provided they are adequately endowed with funding, training and institutional support. The total amount of CO2 storage potential is significant, about 100 million tons per country, but not enough to suggest that forestry can offset more than a few percent of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use.";"22";"WOS:A1991JD40400002";1991;"scenario, project, cost, price, forestri";0.790034176179991;158

   meta-analysis";"Lu, F";"Straw incorporation (SI) is a common practice in China and has important implications for agricultural sustainability. This study aimed to quantitatively summarise the response of top soil (0-20 cm) carbon (C) to SI under different agricultural management regimes. Results indicated that compared with straw removal (SR), SI significantly increased soil C storage by 12 %. Moreover, incorporation of chopped straw with tillage treatment (ploughing and rotary tillage) increased C storage compared to unchopped straw without tillage treatment. SI implementation with upland cropping, in the northwest and northeast resulted in higher C storage compared with rice cropping, and in the northern and southern regions. Changes in soil C were observed based on SI variables, including tillage and straw amounts in fine-textured soils, however straw amount rather than tillage treatment exhibited a greater influence on soil C in coarse-textured soils. We concluded SI implementation with increased amounts of chopped straw for a longer duration was favourable to soil C sequestration in Chinese croplands. Furthermore, we estimated if SI was popularised across all of China's agricultural regions, soil C sequestration potential would reach 48.2 similar to 56.2 Tg C year(-1). SI practices should therefore be encouraged.";"3";"WOS:000363247700016";2015;"treatment, residu, miner, rice, straw";0.786769825875212;89

The genotypes were grouped on the basis of flowering initiation and the physiological observations were recorded during the flowering stage. Highly significant genotypic differences were detected between and within the group for physiological traits, biomass, yield attributes and seed yield. The early flowering genotypes (Group-I) showed lower leaf water potential (LWP), higher leaf water content (RWC), canopy temperature depression (CTD) and photosynthetic rate (P(N)) compared to medium (Group-II) and late (Group III) flowering genotypes.

The CO2Fix (v. 3.1) model was used to examine the influence of litter production, litter quality and microclimate on differences in SOC accretion under exotic tree species established on farmland in southwestern Ethiopia. The SOC storage under Cupressus lusitanica was larger than that under the other two investigated species (Pinus patula and Eucalyptus grandis). This was mainly because of the higher total litter input and higher proportion of fine woody litter (branches and coarse roots) in the Cupressus stand. SOC accretion was,greater under Pinus than under Eucalyptus. However, the total litter input in the Pinus and Eucalyptus stands was nearly the same. The difference between the Pinus and Eucalyptus stands was best explained by the fact that Pinus produced more fine woody litter than did Eucalyptus. Litter quality and microclimate only accounted for a minor part of the differences in SOC storage in the Cupressus, Pinus and Eucalyptus stands. Therefore, the results suggested that total litter input and the proportion of fine woody litter were the main factors that accounted for the interspecific differences in SOC accretion.

The relationships between carbon storage and tree diversity of natural forest at small scale are still unclear. This research investigated these relationships in an old-growth forest at Changbai Mountain, Northeast China. It was found that at small scale, tree carbon storage generally increases with increasing tree species richness, but for stands with same species richness, tree carbon storage varies dramatically. At the small scale, tree species evenness has a significantly linear relationship with nature logarithm of total tree carbon storage. The stand carbon storage of trees is mainly controlled by stand tree composition. Fraxinus mandshurica , Pinus koraiensis , Quercus mongolica , Tilia amurensis , and Acer mono contribute more than 85% of stand carbon storage of trees. Stands with similar tree composition at small scale have different soil organic carbon storage and nutrient contents. Tree species evenness has great impact on soil N content at the soil horizon less than 30 cm deep, but its impacts on C/N, P, K, and S contents are small. Tree density has a negative linear relationship with soil organic C and C:N ratio at the soil horizon is less than 30 cm deep.

   Leduc, S
   Kraxner, F";"This paper is a contribution to the ongoing debate on carbon-negative energy solutions. It deals with biomass conversion in dedicated biopower plants equipped with CCS (BECCS), or co-fired plants retrofitted with CCS in order to generate negative CO2-emissions. In this context, bioenergy refers to the use of biomass to generate electricity (i.e. biopower) in compliance with the needs of nations and regions without seasonal space heating demand. In this paper, direct-fired and co-fired systems will be addressed, combined mainly with post-combustion flue gas cleaning. The question is which CCS alternative should be preferred in order to obtain negative emissions: either building multiple smaller biopower units, or employing co-firing of biomass and coal in existing large coal power plants. Based on efficacy and the potential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions as key indicators, some major differences between the alternatives are shown. In the event that a coal power plant equipped with CCS is readily available, more net electric energy (in MWh) can be provided from the feedstock of biomass than would be obtainable from an independent BECCS plant, although the amount of CO2 captured and stored from the biomass (per tonne) will be essentially the same. Further case-specific cost-benefit analyses will be required to determine the feasibility of carbon-negative energy solutions. Although the study is carried out from the perspective of actual biomass sources as regards biomass composition and available technology (i.e. expected efficiency levels) using Indonesian agricultural residues, its main conclusion is fairly general.

The former plaggic Ap horizon was less acid (by 1.3-1.9 pH(CaCl2) units) and 2-3 times more saturated with mobile phosphorus and potassium compounds in plots on formerly fertilized abandoned arable land than in afforested with pine plantation plots. The total C pool at 100 cm mineral soil depth (including 0 horizons) in abandoned arable land (3.81 kg C m(-2)) was 1.7 times less than in pine plantations (6.52 kg C m(-2)), mainly because of C accumulation in the forest floor (2.24 kg C m(-2)). The differences in mineral horizons were not significant, although the root mass in mineral topsoil was more than 10 times larger in pine plantations, except the surface 0-2 cm layer of the former Ap horizon in which the C pool was 3 times larger in pine plantations (0.72 kg C m(-2)) than in abandoned arable land (0.22 kg C m(-2)). Total soil N pools were at the same level (0.47-0.54 kg N m(-2)) because the mineral soil to the depth of 100 cm contained 90% and more of N in both the abandoned arable land and the pine plantations.

   Zhao, YX";"Geoengineering, which is the intentional large-scale manipulation of the environment, has been suggested as an effective means of mitigating global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we will review and assess technical and theoretical aspects of land-based, atmosphere-based, ocean-based and space-based geoengineering schemes as well as their potential impacts on global climate and ecosystem. Most of the proposed geoengineering schemes carried out on land or in the ocean are to use physical, chemical or biological approaches to remove atmospheric CO2. These schemes are able to only sequester an amount of atmospheric CO2 that is small compared with cumulative anthropogenic emissions. Most of geoengineering schemes carried out in the atmosphere or space are based on increasing planetary albedo. These schemes have relatively low costs and short lead times for technical implementation, and can act rapidly to reduce temperature anomalies caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The costs and benefits of geoengineering are likely to vary spatially over the planet with some countries and regions gaining considerably while others may be faced with a worse set of circumstances than would be the case without geoengineering. Since current research on geoengineering is limited and various international treaties may limit some geoengineering experiments in the real world, the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) provides a framework of coordinated experiments for all earth system modeling groups to test geoengineering schemes. However, these experiments used on a global scale have difficulty with accurate resolution of regional and local impacts, so future research on geoengineering is expect to be done by combining earth system models with regional climate models.

"Carbon stocks of intact mangroves and carbon emissions arising from
   their conversion in the Dominican Republic";"Kauffman, JB

   Norfolk, J
   Payton, F";"Mangroves are recognized to possess a variety of ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration and storage. Deforestation and conversion of these ecosystems continue to be high and have been predicted to result in significant carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Yet few studies have quantified the carbon stocks or losses associated with conversion of these ecosystems. In this study we quantified the ecosystem carbon stocks of three common mangrove types of the Caribbean as well as those of abandoned shrimp ponds in areas formerly occupied by mangrovea common land-use conversion of mangroves throughout the world. In the mangroves of the Montecristi Province in Northwest Dominican Republic we found C stocks ranged from 706 to 1131 Mg/ha. The medium-statured mangroves (3-10 m in height) had the highest C stocks while the tall (>10 m) mangroves had the lowest ecosystem carbon storage. Carbon stocks of the low mangrove (shrub) type (<3 m) were relatively high due to the presence of carbon-rich soils as deep as 2 m. Carbon stocks of abandoned shrimp ponds were 95 Mg/ha or approximate to 11% that of the mangroves. Using a stock-change approach, the potential emissions from the conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds ranged from 2244 to 3799 Mg CO(2)e/ha (CO2 equivalents). This is among the largest measured C emissions from land use in the tropics. The 6260 ha of mangroves and converted mangroves in the Montecristi Province are estimated to contain 3841490 Mg of C. Mangroves represented 76% of this area but currently store 97% of the carbon in this coastal wetland (3696722 Mg C). Converted lands store only 4% of the total ecosystem C (144778 Mg C) while they comprised 24% of the area. By these metrics the replacement of mangroves with shrimp and salt ponds has resulted in estimated emissions from this region totaling 3.8 million Mg CO(2)e or approximate to 21% of the total C prior to conversion. Given the high C stocks of mangroves, the high emissions from their conversion, and the other important functions and services they provide, their inclusion in climate-change mitigation strategies is warranted.";"25";"WOS:000333242300008";2014;"servic, restor, mangrov, coastal, habitat";0.764654355277544;133
"Climate Engineering: Economic Considerations and Research Challenges";"Klepper, G
   Rickels, W";"Climate engineering measures are designed to either reduce atmospheric carbon concentration (by growing trees or spreading iron in the ocean, for example) or directly influence the radiation reaching or leaving the earth (by injecting sulfur into the stratosphere or modifying cloud formations, for example) to compensate for greenhouse gas-induced warming. The former measures are termed carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which we characterize as a low-leverage causative approach, and the latter are termed radiation management (RM), which we characterize as a high-leverage symptomatic approach. There are similarities between CDR and emission control. Accordingly, benefit-cost analysis can be used to assess certain CDR measures. By contrast, high-leverage RM represents a genuinely new option in the climate change response portfolio, at first glance promising insurance against fat-tail climate change risks. However, the persistent intrinsic uncertainties of RM suggest that any cautious climate risk management approach should consider RM as a complement to (rather than a substitute for) emission control at best. Moreover, the complexity of the earth system imposes major limitations on the ability of research to reduce these uncertainties. Thus we argue that a research strategy is needed that focuses on increasing our basic understanding of the earth system and conducting comprehensive assessments of the risk(s) associated with both climate change and the deployment of climate engineering.";"3";"WOS:000340045900008";2014;"optim, terrestri, radiat, forc, centuri";0.761317283060828;114
"LCA of a biorefinery concept producing bioethanol, bioenergy, and
   chemicals from switchgrass";"Cherubini, F
   Jungmeier, G";"The availability of fossil resources is predicted to decrease in the near future: they are a non-renewable source, they cause environmental concerns, and they are subjected to price instability. Utilization of biomass as raw material in a biorefinery is a promising alternative to fossil resources for production of energy carriers and chemicals, as well as for mitigating climate change and enhancing energy security. This paper focuses on a biorefinery concept which produces bioethanol, bioenergy, and biochemicals from switchgrass, a lignocellulosic crop. Results are compared with a fossil reference system producing the same products/services from fossil sources.
   The biorefinery system is investigated using a Life Cycle Assessment approach, which takes into account all the input and output flows occurring along the production chain. This paper elaborates on methodological key issues like land use change effects and soil N(2)O emissions, whose influence on final outcomes is weighted in a sensitivity analysis. Since climate change mitigation and energy security are the two most important driving forces for biorefinery development, the assessment has a focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cumulative primary energy demand (distinguished into fossil and renewable), but other environmental impact categories (e.g., abiotic depletion, eutrophication, etc.) are assessed as well.
   The use of switchgrass in a biorefinery offsets GHG emissions and reduces fossil energy demand: GHG emissions are decreased by 79% and about 80% of non-renewable energy is saved. Soil C sequestration is responsible for a large GHG benefit (65 kt CO(2)-eq/a, for the first 20 years), while switchgrass production is the most important contributor to total GHG emissions of the system. If compared with the fossil reference system, the biorefinery system releases more N(2)O emissions, while both CO(2) and CH(4) emissions are reduced. The investigation of the other impact categories revealed that the biorefinery has higher impacts in two categories: acidification and eutrophication.
   Results are mainly affected by raw material (i.e., switchgrass) production and land use change effects. Steps which mainly influence the production of switchgrass are soil N(2)O emissions, manufacture of fertilizers (especially those nitrogen-based), processing (i.e., pelletizing and drying), and transport. Even if the biorefinery chain has higher primary energy demand than the fossil reference system, it is mainly based on renewable energy (i.e., the energy content of the feedstock): the provision of biomass with sustainable practices is then a crucial point to ensure a renewable energy supply to biorefineries.
   This biorefinery system is an effective option for mitigating climate change, reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, and enhancing cleaner production chains based on local and renewable resources. However, this assessment evidences that determination of the real GHG and energy balance (and all other environmental impacts in general) is complex, and a certain degree of uncertainty is always present in final results. Ranges in final results can be even more widened by applying different combinations of biomass feedstocks, conversion routes, fuels, end-use applications, and methodological assumptions.
   This study demonstrated that the perennial grass switchgrass enhances carbon sequestration in soils if established on set-aside land, thus, considerably increasing the GHG savings of the system for the first 20 years after crop establishment. Given constraints in land resources and competition with food, feed, and fiber production, high biomass yields are extremely important in achieving high GHG emission savings, although use of chemical fertilizers to enhance plant growth can reduce the savings. Some strategies, aiming at simultaneously maintaining crop yield and reduce N fertilization application through alternative management, can be adopted. However, even if a reduction in GHG emissions is achieved, it should not be disregarded that additional environmental impacts (like acidification and eutrophication) may be caused. This aspect cannot be ignored by policy makers, even if they have climate change mitigation objectives as main goal.";"93";"WOS:000273176400006";2010;"ghg, bioenergi, biofuel, energi, life";0.760388500783176;85

   nitrogen sequestration in a tropical agroforestry system";"Sierra, J
   Nygren, P";"Agroforestry is often mentioned as a suitable technology for land rehabilitation in the tropics and for mitigation of climate change because this land-use favours nutrient recycling and C sequestration. The aim of this work was to estimate soil C sequestration in a 12-year-old tropical silvopastoral system composed of a legume tree (Gliricidia sepium) and a C4 fodder grass (Dichanthium aristatum), and to link it with tree root biomass and N status in the soil. The site was under cut-and-carry management, i.e. tree pruning residues and cut grass were removed from the field and fed to stabled animals elsewhere. Thus, main sources for tree C and N inputs were root activity and turnover. Organic C derived from the trees and tree root biomass were determined based on natural C-13 abundance. For the 0-0.2 m soil layer, the biomass of tree roots <= 2 mm diameter was 2.4 Mg/ha when the trees were pruned every 6 months (SS6), and 0.6 Mg/ha when pruned every 2 months (SS2). Both C (R-2 = 0.39, P < 0.05) and N (R-2 = 0.82, P < 0.05) sequestration were correlated with tree root biomass. The trees and grass contributed 18 and 8 Mg C/ha to soil, respectively, over the 12-year experiment in SS6. The net increase of 2.5 Mg N/ha in soil, originating from the trees, contributed to the net soil C sequestration. In SS2, trees contributed 16 Mg C/ha to soil over 12 years, but grass-derived C was reduced by 2 Mg C/ha because of the small amount of grass litter. The increase of 1.7 Mg N/ha in soil, derived from the trees, was not large enough to avoid C loss in this plot. Differences in soil C and N sequestration between plots were due to differences in system management, which affected the amount and the C/N ratio of inputs and outputs.";"13";"WOS:000231016400012";2005;"tree, speci, stand, root, litter";0.758399234919409;163

As it is not feasible to perform long-term (decades, centuries) laboratory experiments to assess biochar evolution after soil amendment, the study of ancient archaeological charcoals can help to identify characteristics (and possibly molecular markers) associated with the decomposition and preservation dynamics of biochar in specific pedoclimatic environments. In this study, the chemical composition of the organic carbon fractions of three charcoals from pre-European Mori gardens of New Zealand (buried >25cm depth) was thoroughly assessed. Complementary short-term incubations of charcoals in sand were used to (i) evaluate the stability of C in the short-medium term, (ii) model its mineralization processes and (iii) estimate the C turnover. Elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TG), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Py-GC-MS) gave consistent results in describing the charring intensity and the degree of polycondensation of these charcoals. The oldest buried deposit (770 +/- 50years BP) still retained un-charred or weakly charred lignocellulosic material, indicating that such material survived decomposition processes for several centuries. The amount of organic C mineralized in 109days was <0.5% of the initial charcoal-C. No differences in MRT among samples were detected in spite of inferred differences in thermal impact. Longer-term incubations are needed to obtain better estimates of C turnover rates in charred material.";"10";"WOS:000329429800011";2014;"degre, stabil, char, charcoal, decomposit";0.758091544637811;92

We examined the potential trade-offs when selecting non-forested lands in New Zealand for natural forest regeneration to maximise gains in either, or both, carbon and biodiversity. We also examine the effect on potential gains and trade-offs of excluding non-conservation lands from spatial planning for conservation. The most significant per-hectare gains, for both carbon and biodiversity, were those occurring on non-conservation lands because conservation lands are mainly restricted to low-productivity environments where indigenous vegetation is already well represented. By contrast, productive environments, such as alluvial plains, where almost no indigenous vegetation remains, are primarily on non-conservation lands. These lands will need to be included in any reforestation strategy or else the most degraded ecosystems will not be restored. We found that biodiversity suffers a greater trade-off when carbon gain is prioritised than carbon does when biodiversity is prioritised. Trade-offs between carbon and biodiversity were higher on non-conservation lands but decreased with increasing area regenerated. Our study shows that natural regeneration will provide substantial increases in carbon and biodiversity on non-conservation lands compared with conservation lands. This emphasised the need for improved incentives to private land owners if carbon and biodiversity gain from afforestation is to be maximised. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It also has the potential to reduce environmental impacts from waste management such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change. This paper analyzes the life cycle GHG emissions associated with a novel process for the conversion of food processing waste into ethanol (EtOH) and the co-products of compost and animal feed. Data are based on a pilot plant co-fermenting retail food waste with a sugary industrial wastewater, using a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process at room temperature with a grinding pretreatment. The process produced 295 L EtOH/dry t feedstock. Lifecycle GHG emissions associated with the ethanol production process were 1458 gCO(2)e/L EtOH. When the impact of avoided landfill emissions from diverting food waste to use as feedstock are considered, the process results in net negative GHG emissions and approximately 500% improvement relative to corn ethanol or gasoline production. This finding illustrates how feedstock and alternative waste disposal options have important implications in life cycle GHG results for waste-to-energy pathways.

We compared a 20-year chronosequence of created tidal wetland sites in Tampa Bay, Florida (USA) to natural reference mangrove wetlands. Across the chronosequence, our sites represent the succession from salt marsh to mangrove forest communities. Our results identify important soil and plant structural differences between the created and natural reference wetland sites; however, they also depict a positive developmental trajectory for the created wetland sites that reflects tightly coupled plant-soil development. Because upland soils and/or dredge spoils were used to create the new mangrove habitats, the soils at younger created sites and at lower depths (10-30 cm) had higher bulk densities, higher sand content, lower soil organic matter (SOM), lower total carbon (TC), and lower total nitrogen (TN) than did natural reference wetland soils. However, in the upper soil layer (0-10 cm), SOM, TC, and TN increased with created wetland site age simultaneously with mangrove forest growth. The rate of created wetland soil C accumulation was comparable to literature values for natural mangrove wetlands. Notably, the time to equivalence for the upper soil layer of created mangrove wetlands appears to be faster than for many other wetland ecosystem types. Collectively, our findings characterize the rate and trajectory of above- and below-ground changes associated with ecosystem development in created mangrove wetlands; this is valuable information for environmental managers planning to sustain existing mangrove wetlands or mitigate for mangrove wetland losses.";"28";"WOS:000306952400012";2012;"servic, restor, mangrov, coastal, habitat";0.754938106332208;133
"TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS AS CARBON SINKS";"SOEPADMO, E";"Though since the early seventies the debate on the increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and its predicted impact on global climate has been the focus of many national, regional, and international discussions, and that deforestation in the tropics has been identified as one of the main contributing factors, very few detailed studies have actually been made on the primary production and rate of carbon storage/release of tropical forests.
   To appreciate the importance of tropical forests as carbon sinks, published data on carbon storage in tropical forest biomass, soil and litter were reviewed and synthesized. The data showed that: 1) in the seventies, the total area of tropical forests of the world stood at about 1,628 x 10(6) hectares, of which about 58% or 1,043.90 x 10(6) hectares was contributed by tropical closed moist forests, and the remaining 42 % by savanna-type dry forests. 2) Of the ca. 1,043.90 x 10(6) hectares of tropical closed moist forests, about 53.8% are located in Central and South America, 28% in Asia and Oceania, and 18.2% in Africa. 3) Total storage of organic carbon (approximately equal to 50% of organic matter) amounted to 393.50 x 10(9) tonnes, with vegetation accounting  for 58%, soil 41%, and litter 1%. Approximately 50% of the total storage was contributed by tropical moist and rain forests. 4) Total litter, production tropical forests was estimated at about 6.15 x 10(9) tonnes (Carbon), of which about 53% of was produced by tropical dry and moist rain forests, with the tropical moist rain forests accounted for about 30%. Turnover time of litter in tropical forests was less than 1.0 year. 5) The rates of gross primary production in tropical forests ranged from 9.5 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year in subtropical dry forests to 100 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year in tropical moist rain forests; and that of net production from 5.5 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year (Subtropical dry forests) to 36.0 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year (lowland tropical moist forests)
   In conclusion, it may be restated that based on rather limited available data, tropical forests, particularly the undisturbed moist and rain forests, play an important role as carbon sinks in the global carbon cycle. These forests store about 46% of the world's living terrestrial carbon pool and about 11.55% of the world's soil carbon pool. Thus, any form of destruction (burning) or reduction in area of these forests will lead to a substantial increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Notwithstanding this, it should be stressed that more accurate and up to date studies, using remote-sensing techniques and ground surveys to establish the actual area of the remaining tropical forests and at the rate of which these forests are being eliminated annually are urgently needed. Equally wanting are in situ measurements of the rate of primary production and respiration of each of the forest types prevailing in tropical regions of the world.";"11";"WOS:A1993LY92000006";1993;"forest, reforest, china, tropic, deforest";0.75315427790853;225
"The effects of ammonium sulfate application on methane emission and soil
   carbon content of a paddy field in Japan";"Minamikawa, K
   Sakai, N
   Hayashi, H";"Decreases in methane (CH4) emission from paddy fields are important for mitigating global warming. Some substrates such as soil carbon are used by methanogens for CH4 production. Thus, changes in CH4 emission may be accompanied by changes in soil carbon content.
   This study was carried out at an experimental paddy field in Agricultural and Forestry Research Center, University of Tsukuba, Japan. The experimental variables were rates of ammonium sulfate application (AS; 0, 45, 90, and 135 kg N ha(-1)) and levels of rice (Oryza sativa L., cultivar: Koshihikari) plant density (PD; 18.5 and 30.3 hill m(-2)). During the rice growing period, we measured CH4 emission by a closed-chamber method, and soil carbon content. Then, we considered the effects of the variables on CH4 emission and soil carbon content, and analyzed the quantitative relationship between them.
   There were no effects of PD level on CH4 emission and soil carbon content. This was likely due to the compensatory effect of rice plants. The CH4 emission decreased with increases in AS application rate, caused by competition for substrates between sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens. Decreases in soil redox potential (E-h) were delayed with increases in AS application rate. This process was another cause for the decreased CH4 emission at higher rates of AS application, but the reason for the higher soil E-h is not clear. Soil carbon content decreased with increases in AS application rate. Thus, there was a positive linear correlation between CH4 emission and soil carbon content (R-2 = 0.977).
   Consequently, although AS application was effective to decrease CH4 emission, it simultaneously stimulated soil carbon decomposition. Carbon is stored in the soil in huge quantities, and is partly decomposed to carbon dioxide, also a greenhouse gas. Thus, it is necessary to consider not only CH4 emission but also soil carbon storage for mitigating global warming. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"Does Tree Species Composition Affect Productivity in a Tropical Planted
   Forest?";"Salisbury, CL
   Potvin, C";"With growing pressure on primary forests from destructive land uses, increasing the diversity of native species plantations can increase ecosystem service provision, such as timber production or carbon sequestration, thus better supporting sustainable livelihoods. Understanding the effects of tree species composition on productivity can inform plantation design and ecological restoration strategies. However, tree species composition effects have been neglected in experimental biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) research. This study uses a 10-yr data set from one of the first tropical planted forest experiments established with native species and designed for BEF research at scales relevant to forest management. At our site in Sardinilla, Panama, we established plots containing 6 species from a pool of 18, in four combinations, to investigate how composition affects species and plot productivity. We used basal area as a proxy for productivity through time, measured annually, and summed this at species and plot levels for analysis. We found that plots that differed in species composition appeared to differ in temporal rate of basal area increase, but did not differ in BA after 10yr. Species were generally consistent in size between compositions, and composition performance was correlated with the size of component species, suggesting that species identities were most important in determining plot productivity. Our results suggest that species choice can be based on preferences for individual species, as species performance was consistent across composition contexts. We make recommendations for the use of particularly productive species that also provide multiple services such as Guazuma ulmifolia, Spondias mombin, and Anacardium excelsum.
   Resumen Con la presion cada vez mayor sobre los bosques primarios proveniente de utilizaciones del suelo destructivas, el aumento de la diversidad de plantaciones de especies nativas puede aumentar la prestacion de servicios de los ecosistemas, tales como la produccion de madera o la captura de carbono, y por lo tanto, aumentar el apoyo a medios de vida sostenibles. La comprension de los efectos de la composicion de las especies de arboles en la productividad, puede informar sobre el diseno de plantacion y las estrategias de restauracion ecologica. Sin embargo, los efectos de la composicion de especies de arboles se han descuidado en las investigaciones de funcion experimental de la biodiversidad en los ecosistemas o BEF por sus siglas en ingles. Este estudio utiliza un conjunto de datos de 10 anos de uno de los primeros experimentos establecido en bosques tropicales con especies nativas y disenado para la investigacion BEF a escalas relevantes para la gestion forestal. En nuestro sitio en Sardinilla, Panama, establecimos parcelas que contienen seis especies de un grupo de dieciocho anos, en cuatro combinaciones, para investigar como la composicion afecta las especies y la productividad en las parcelas. Utilizamos el area basal como proxy de la productividad a traves del tiempo, medido anualmente, y esto lo sumamos al nivel de las especies y las parcelas para el analisis. Se encontro que las parcelas que diferian en la composicion de especies parecian diferir en la tasa de incremento temporal de la zona basal pero no difirieron en el area basal despues de 10 anos. Las especies fueron generalmente consistentes en tamano entre las composiciones, y el rendimiento de la composicion se correlaciono con el tamano de las especies que lo componen, lo que sugiere que la identidad de las especies fue mas importante para determinar la productividad en la parcela. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la eleccion de las especies puede estar basada en las preferencias por las distintas especies, ya que el rendimiento de especies fue consistente en contextos de composicion.

"Efficacy of geoengineering to limit 21st century sea-level rise";"Moore, JC
   Jevrejeva, S
   Grinsted, A";"Geoengineering has been proposed as a feasible way of mitigating anthropogenic climate change, especially increasing global temperatures in the 21st century. The two main geoengineering options are limiting incoming solar radiation, or modifying the carbon cycle. Here we examine the impact of five geoengineering approaches on sea level; SO(2) aerosol injection into the stratosphere, mirrors in space, afforestation, biochar, and bioenergy with carbon sequestration. Sea level responds mainly at centennial time scales to temperature change, and has been largely driven by anthropogenic forcing since 1850. Making use a model of sea-level rise as a function of time-varying climate forcing factors (solar radiation, volcanism, and greenhouse gas emissions) we find that sea-level rise by 2100 will likely be 30 cm higher than 2000 levels despite all but the most aggressive geoengineering under all except the most stringent greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The least risky and most desirable way of limiting sea-level rise is bioenergy with carbon sequestration. However aerosol injection or a space mirror system reducing insolation at an accelerating rate of 1 Wm(-2) per decade from now to 2100 could limit or reduce sea levels. Aerosol injection delivering a constant 4 Wm(-2) reduction in radiative forcing (similar to a 1991 Pinatubo eruption every 18 months) could delay sea-level rise by 40-80 years. Aerosol injection appears to fail cost-benefit analysis unless it can be maintained continuously, and damage caused by the climate response to the aerosols is less than about 0.6% Global World Product.";"36";"WOS:000281637800015";2010;"optim, terrestri, radiat, forc, centuri";0.750761133403292;114

   Piao, SL";"By integrating the reflectance of 7 spectral bands of the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiaometer (MODIS) and forest inventory data with an empirical statistical model, we mapped the spatial distribution of total forest biomass carbon density (BCD) at 1 km resolution in China during the past decade. The empirical statistical model can explain 75% of the variation in BCD across 29 provinces in China (R-2 = 0.75, P < 0.001), with a root mean square error of 9.3 Mg C ha(-1). The total forest biomass carbon storage was estimated as 6.4 +/- 0.6 Pg C, with an average BCD of 42.6 +/- 3.9 Mg C ha(-1) during the period of 2001-2005, which is close to the estimates solely by forest inventory data. During the 2000s, the forests in China sequestered carbon by 80 +/- 103 Tg C yr(-1). Our estimation is close to an independent forest biomass estimation (76 +/- 10 Tg C yr(-1)) derived from passive microwave satellites (Liu et al., 2015). Most of the forest biomass carbon sink was attributed to the growth of low- and medium-biomass forests in eastern, central, and southern China. The large area of currently low-biomass forests will retain as a large potential biomass C sink in the next few decades. This implicates that low-biomass forests (most of these forests are planted forests) need well management such as selected wood harvest to keep large forest biomass carbon sinks in China. Plans of sustainable afforestation and forests protection projects by Chinese government could also enhance the forest biomass carbon sinks in the future. Nitrogen deposition in China significantly correlates with forest biomass C sinks across 2392 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid cells (R = 0.54, P < 0.001), which indicate the positive impacts of nitrogen deposition on China's forest biomass carbon sinks. Our results suggest that China forests can continue to act as a large carbon sinks in the near future because of the contributions of management of low- and medium-biomass forests, afforestation and nitrogen deposition.

To meet the goals of forest management on afforested fields, information on the effects of former agricultural land use on soil fertility is needed. In this study, we examine the soil fertility of 12 former arable fields afforested either 10 or 60-70 years ago with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and adjacent sites that have been forested continuously. Volumetric soil samples were collected from the organic soil layer and from mineral soil to a depth of 40 cm. Soil samples were analyzed for pH, bulk density, organic matter content and amounts of nutrients (Kjeldahl N, extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn and B). On afforested fields, amounts of nutrients in the mineral soil, especially in 10-year-old afforestations, were higher than on continuously forested sites. In the organic layer plus the 0-40 cm soil layer, the 10-year-old afforestations had 68% more N, 41% more P, 83% more K, 252% more Ca, 6% more Mg, 61% more Zn and 33% more B than the continuously forested sites at a comparable soil depth. In the 60-70-year-old afforestations, the differences were significant only for N, Ca and Zn (20% more N, 121% more Ca and 115% more Zn than on the continuously forested sites). The effects of agriculture on amounts of nutrients were most clearly detected in the former plough layer (0-20 cm) of the 10-year-old afforestations and in the top layer (0-10 cm) of the older afforestations. Amounts of nutrients in the organic layer of the afforested sites were lower, but their concentrations were higher than in the continuously forested sites. On the 10-year-old afforestations, the bulk density of the mineral soil tended to be lower and the organic matter content higher than on the continuously forested sites. On both young and old afforestations, soil pH was higher than on the continuously forest sites. According to these results, changes in soil properties caused by agriculture have increased the soil fertility and therefore probably also the site index. The results also suggest that changes in soil properties due to agricultural land use are quite long lasting.";"36";"WOS:000233381600022";2005;"afforest, plantat, stock, pine, layer";0.749143525537457;123
"Ecosystem carbon stocks of mangrove forests along the Pacific and
   Caribbean coasts of Honduras";"Bhomia, RK

   McFadden, TN";"Among the many ecosystem services provided by mangrove ecosystems, their role in carbon (C) sequestration and storage is quite high compared to other tropical forests. Mangrove forests occupy less than 1 % of tropical forested areas but account for approximately 3 % of global carbon sequestration by tropical forests. Yet there remain many areas where little data on the size and variation of mangrove C stocks exist. To address this gap and examine the range of C stocks in mangroves at landscape scales, we quantified C stocks of Honduran mangroves along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts and the Bay Islands. We also examined differences in ecosystem C stocks due to size and structure of mangrove vegetation found in Honduras. Ecosystem C stocks ranged from 570 Mg C ha(-1) in the Pacific coast to similar to 1000 Mg C ha(-1) in Caribbean coast and the Bay Islands. Ecosystem C stocks on the basis of mangrove structure were 1200, 800 and 900 Mg C ha(-1), in low, medium and tall mangroves, respectively. We did not find significant differences in ecosystem C stocks on the basis of location (Pacific coast, Caribbean coast and Bay Islands) or mangrove type (low, medium and tall). Mangrove soils represented the single largest pool of total C in these ecosystems, with 87, 81 and 94 % at the Pacific coast, Caribbean coast and the Bay Islands, respectively. While there were no significant differences in total ecosystem stocks among mangrove types, there were differences in where carbon is stored. Mangrove soils among low, medium and tall mangroves contained 99, 93 and 80 % of the total ecosystem C stocks. In addition, we found a small yet significant negative correlation between vegetation C pools and pore water salinity and pH at the sampled sites. Conversion of mangroves into other land use types such as aquaculture or agriculture could result in loses of these soil C reserves due to mineralization and oxidation. Coupled with their other ecosystem services, an understanding of the size of mangrove ecosystem C stocks underscores their values in the formulation of conservation and climate change mitigation strategies in Central America.";"1";"WOS:000374592800007";2016;"servic, restor, mangrov, coastal, habitat";0.744710502284035;133
"Carbon sequestration, soil conservation, and the kyoto protocol: Summary
   of implications";"Dumanski, J";"This paper discusses relationships between soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol is the first attempt to use the flexibility of the global market place to stabilize and reduce GHG emissions, mitigate climate change, and promote sustainable development. The protocol emerged first as a framework agreement, but through international negotiations it is progressing into sets of legal articles. These impose obligations on all signatories, but they also identify opportunities for improved environmental land management at local, national and international levels. This is particularly true for soil conservation, where the sequestration of carbon above and below ground increases soil organic matter, enhances soil fertility, and improves production, while concomitantly reducing atmospheric CO2. It is a classic 'win-win' situation. Both the evolving opportunities and the obligations under the Kyoto Protocol are discussed in the paper.";"21";"WOS:000223361500002";2004;"polici, market, protocol, kyoto, intern";0.742740150481351;163

   pre-incubation";"Akagi, J
   Zsolnay, A
   Bastida, F";"The dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils is essentially defined by the way in which it is obtained. Therefore, we need to understand as to how pre-treatment of a soil will affect the characteristics of DOM, since this fraction may be strongly influenced by a soil's water content. The effect of two different pre-treatments on DOM from the A-horizons of a large variety of ecosystems and regions were compared. In both cases the soils were allowed to air-dry. In one case the air-dried soil was directly extracted (AD), while in the other case it was pre-incubated for I week at 50% of its water holding capacity (INCU). AD is simpler, but INCU brings the soil, and especially its microbial population, back to a standardised state, which is more representative of the Usual state in the field. Both methods are used whenever an adjustment of the soil water content is essential to compare different regions or to eliminate short term weather effects. A significant regression indicated that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) extracted from INCU samples was only 20% of AD DOC. Both the absorptivity (UV absorption divided by DOC) of 86% of the samples, and a fluorescence emission spectrum based Humification Index in all cases increased as a result of pre-incubation. This would indicate that labile compounds released during drying were metabolised during the incubation. However, the magnitude of this increase varied, and no correlation with soil organic and microbial carbon, pH, or texture could be detected. The results show that DOM extracted from AD and INCU soils is not comparable and that the differences are mainly due to the impact of air-drying on the microbial activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The model system is realized within a GIS-based modular software framework and includes a spatial two-scale hierarchy with the macro-level representing administrative units and the micro-level being defined by a I X I kin grid. First application of HILLS is the assessment of soil carbon sequestration due to cropland abandonment in the federal state of Hesse, Germany. For this study the land use model LUCHesse has been newly developed and coupled to a modified version of the Century model (GIS-Century) in the HILLS context. LUCHesse regionalizes macro-level area trends of land use types to the grid level in annual time steps. The generated sequence of land use maps serves as input to GIS-Century for calculating soil carbon sequestration. The paper focuses on the conceptual and software aspects of HILLS as well as on the implementation for the Hessian study. Furthermore results of model testing and application of the integrated model to the problem in question are presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   Foley, JA";"Various geoengineering schemes have been proposed to counteract anthropogenically induced climate change. In a previous study, it was suggested that a 1.8% reduction in solar radiation incident on the Earth's surface could noticeably reduce regional and seasonal climate change from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the response of the terrestrial biosphere to reduced solar radiation in a CO2-rich climate was not investigated. In this study, we hypothesized that a reduction in incident solar radiation in a Doubled CO2 atmosphere will diminish the net primary productivity (NPP) of terrestrial ecosystems, potentially accelerating the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. We used a dynamic global ecosystem model, the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS), to investigate this hypothesis in an unperturbed climatology. While this simplified modeling framework effectively separated the influence of CO2 and sunlight on the terrestrial biosphere, it did not consider the complex feed-backs within the Earth's climate system. Our analysis indicated that compared to a Doubled CO2 scenario, reduction in incident solar radiation by 1.8% in a double CO2 world will have negligible impact on the NPP of terrestrial ecosystems. There were, however, spatial variations in the response of NPP-engineered solar radiation. While productivity decreased by less than 2% in the tropical and boreal forests as hypothesized, it increased by a similar percentage in the temperate deciduous forests and grasslands. This increase in productivity was attributed to a similar to1% reduction in evapotranspiration in the Geoengineered scenario relative to the Doubled CO2 scenario. Our initial hypothesis was rejected because of unanticipated effects of engineered solar radiation on the hydrologic cycle. However, any geoengineering approaches that reduce incident solar radiation need to be thoroughly analyzed in view of the implications on ecosystem productivity and the hydrologic cycle.";"16";"WOS:000186755100007";2003;"optim, terrestri, radiat, forc, centuri";0.735695220204803;114

Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of drought events, with uncertain consequences for soil microbial communities. In this study we tested the hypothesis that agricultural management used to enhance soil carbon stocks would increase the stability of microbial community structure and activity in response to water-stress. Soil was sampled from a long-term field trial with three soil carbon management systems and was used in a laboratory study of the effect of a dry wet cycle on organic C mineralisation and microbial community structure. After a drying-rewetting event, soil microcosms were maintained wet and microbial community structure and abundance as well as microbial respiration were measured for four weeks. The results showed that the NO-TILL management system, with the highest soil organic matter content and respiration rate, had a distinct bacterial community structure relative to the conventional and the TILL without fertiliser systems. In all management systems, the rewetting event clearly modified microbial community structure and activity. Both returned to their pre-drought state after 28 days. However, the magnitude of variation of C mineralisation was lower (i.e. the resistance to stress was higher) in the NO-TILL system. The genetic structure of the NO-TILL bacterial communities was most modified by water-stress and exhibited a slower recovery rate. This suggests that land use management can increase microbial functional resistance to drought stress via the establishment of bacterial communities with particular metabolic capacities. Nevertheless, the resilience rates of C mineralisation were similar among management regimes, suggesting that similar mechanisms occur, maybe due to a common soil microbial community legacy.

This study focuses on the effect of different methods of organic matter application on the soil organic carbon sequestration in a 4-month experiment under controlled greenhouse conditions. Three rates of straw residue and farmyard manure were added to uncultivated and cropland soils. Two treatments of straw residue and farmyard manure incorporation were used into: a soil surface layer and 0-20 cm soil depth. The result showed that the application of organic matter, especially the farmyard manure incorporation led to a significant increase in the final soil organic carbon content. Higher amounts of soil organic carbon were stored in the cropland soil than in the uncultivated soil. On average, the soil surface layer treatment caused a higher sequestration of soil organic carbon compared to the whole soil depth treatment. If higher rates of organic matter were added to the soils, lower carbon sequestration was observed and vice versa. The result indicated that the carbon sequestration ranged farmyard manure > straw residue and cropland soil > uncultivated soil. The findings of this research revealed the necessity of paying more attention to the role of organic residue management in carbon sequestration and prevention of increasing global warming.";"6";"WOS:000335515300005";2014;"treatment, residu, miner, rice, straw";0.733747249158217;89

This paper estimates the maximum potential quantity and associated costs of increasing the storage of carbon by afforestation of existing agricultural land in the 11 states of the Northeast United States. The focus of the work was to describe location, the quantity, and at what cost it would be economically attractive to shift agricultural production to afforestation to increase carbon storage in the region. Widely available data sets were used to (1) identify spatially-explicit areas for lower costs carbon offsets and (2) estimate carbon supply curves related to afforestation of agricultural land over three time periods (10, 20, and 40 years). Carbon accumulation and total carbon offset project costs were estimated at a county scale and combined to identify expected costs per ton of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)e). Large variation in estimated costs per ton of CO(2)e are driven by varying carbon accumulation potentials and opportunity costs of taking land out of agricultural production, as well as the duration of the project activity. Results show that the lowest cost carbon offset projects will be in certain counties of Maine, Vermont, and New York. Pasture land, with lower opportunity costs, generally presents the opportunity for lower cost carbon offset projects relative to cropland. This analysis estimates that afforestation of pasture land in the northeast will not become economically attractive until the price rises above $10 per metric tonne (MT) CO(2)e and that up to 583 million MT could be economically sequestered if the price were to rise to $50 per MT CO(2)e, based on a 40-year project life. With regard to cropland in the northeast, afforestation does not become economically advantageous for land owners until the price rises above $40 per MT CO(2)e. It is estimated that up to 487,000 MT could be sequestered from cropland if the price were to rise to $50 per MT CO(2)e, based on a 40-year project life.";"3";"WOS:000297367200006";2011;"scenario, project, cost, price, forestri";0.731945922173033;158

There is also a growing recognition of the potential beneficial impact that secondary forests may have on the global environment: providing crucial ecosystem services such as soil conservation, stabilization of hydrological cycles, carbon sequestration, and support for forest dependent communities. Consequently, there is a growing awareness of the need to recognize that landscapes are complex shifting mosaics wherein forest clearing and reforestation take place. In this study, the rates of reforestation, deforestation, forest regrowth and degradation were measured using multi-temporal Landsat images of Danjiangkou, China. Landsat data from 1990, 1999 and 2007 were (1) classified as dense forest, open forest and non-forest areas and (2) compared between years to identify forest cutting, regeneration and degradation. The results showed that there was a net gain of 29,315 ha of forest area (including dense and open forest) from 1990 to 2007, showing a clear trend of reforestation in the study area. Forest modification (degradation and regrowth) and change categories (deforestation and reforestation) occurred simultaneously during the observation time period. Socioeconomic data from public statistics and environmental attributes allowed the assessment of the socioeconomic factors and the environmental conditions that caused these changes using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). The research showed that the socioeconomic factors due to different policies were major driving forces of forest transition, whereas environmental attributes of the underlying landscape constrained forest cover changes. These findings have led to a better understanding of forest transition at a local scale in our study region. Comprehensive knowledge of these relationships may be useful to reconstruct past forest transitions and predict future changes, and may help to enhance sustainable management practices aimed at preserving essential ecological functions.

"What carbon farming activities are farmers likely to adopt? A best-worst
   scaling survey";"Dumbrell, NP

   Gibson, FL";"Transferring carbon from the atmosphere into terrestrial sinks through carbon sequestration practices (so-called 'carbon farming') has been proposed as an important component in Australia's efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. We use a Best worst scaling survey to determine which carbon sequestration practices farmers would be most and least likely to adopt, and what factors were most important in any potential adoption decision. The survey was distributed to dryland cropping and mixed crop-livestock farmers in Western Australia. Farmers ranked improved soil quality and reduced soil erosion as the most important potential co-benefits of carbon farming. Factors discouraging farmers from participating in carbon farming contracts were policy and carbon price uncertainty and the uncertain impact of carbon farming practices on productivity and profitability. Farmers had strong preferences for stubble retention and no-till cropping practices as carbon farming strategies. The practices that farmers preferred least were applying biochar and planting trees. Farm and farmer characteristics, including (lack of) awareness of carbon farming policies and opinions about climate change, influence the potential willingness to adopt different carbon farming practices. Given recent policy uncertainty and farmer preferences revealed in this study, it is important to communicate potential co-benefits (rather than opportunities to earn compensation or carbon credits) to increase farmers' engagement in carbon sequestration activities.

Soil organic carbon (OC) sequestration is promoted by NT agriculture, but this may be offset by increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. We assessed the GWP of a NT as compared to conventional tillage (CT) in a subtropical Brazilian Ferralsol.
   Methods From September 2008 to September 2009 we used static chambers and chromatographic analyses to assess N2O and methane (CH4) soil fluxes in an area previously used for 3-4 years as a field-experiment. The winter cover crop was ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) while in summer it was silage maize (Zea mays L.).
   Results The accumulated N2O emission for NT was about half that of CT (1.26 vs 2.42 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), P = 0.06). Emission peaks for N2O occurred for a month after CT, presumably induced by mineralization of residual nitrogen. In both systems, the highest N2O flux occurred after sidedressing maize with inorganic nitrogen, although the flux was lower in NT than CT (132 vs 367 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), P = 0.05), possibly because some of the sidedressed nitrogen was immobilized by ryegrass residues on the surface of the NT soil. Neither water-filled pore space (WFPS) nor inorganic nitrogen (NH (4) (+) and NO (3) (-) ) correlated with N2O fluxes, although at some specific periods relationships were observed with inorganic nitrogen. Soils subjected to CT or NT both acted as CH4 sinks during most of the experiment, although a CH4 peak in May (autumn) led to overall CH4 emissions of 1.15 kg CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1) for CT and 1.08 kg CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1) for NT (P = 0.90). The OC stock in the 0-20 cm soil layer was slightly higher for NT than for CT (67.20 vs 66.49 Mg ha(-1), P = 0.36). In the 0-100 cm layer, the OC stock was significantly higher for NT as compared to CT (234.61 vs 231.95 Mg ha(-1), P = 0.01), indicating that NT resulted in the sequestration of OC at a rate of 0.76 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). The CO2 equivalent cost of agronomic practices was similar for CT (1.72 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1)) and NT (1.62 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1)). However, NT reduced the GWP relative to CT (-0.55 vs 2.90 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1)), with the difference of -3.45 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1) (negative value implies mitigation) being driven mainly by OC sequestration. The greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI, equivalent to GWP/silage yield) was lower for NT than CT (-31.7 vs 171.1 kg CO(2)eq Mg-1 for silage maize).
   Conclusion As compared to CT, greenhouse gas emissions from a subtropical soil can be mitigated by NT by lowering N2O emissions and, principally, sequestration of CO2-C.";"18";"WOS:000311299800029";2012;"ha1, n2o, yr1, pastur, flux";0.726932512809593;104

Soil management can favor atmospheric carbon incorporation into SUM or its release from SOM to atmosphere. Thus, the evaluation of the humification degree (HD), which is an indication of the recalcitrance of SOM, can provide an estimation of the capacity of carbon sequestration by soils under various managements. The HD of SOM can be estimated by using various analytical techniques including fluorescence spectroscopy. In the present work, the potential of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to estimate the HD of SUM was evaluated for the first time. Intensities of emission lines of Al, Mg and Ca from LIBS spectra showing correlation with fluorescence emissions determined by laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) reference technique were used to obtain a multivaried calibration model based on the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method. The values predicted by the proposed model (A-LIBS) showed strong correlation with LIFS results with a Pearson's coefficient of 0.87. The HD of SUM obtained after normalizing A-LIBS by total carbon in the sample showed a strong correlation to that determined by LIFS (0.94), thus suggesting the great potential of LIBS for this novel application.

Mangroves have survived extreme fluctuations in sea level in the past through sedimentation and belowground carbon (C) accumulation, yet it is unclear what factors may influence these two parameters. We measured sedimentation, vertical accretion, and belowground C accumulation rates in mangrove forests from the Republic of Palau and Vietnam to examine how diversity (high-Vietnam vs. low-Palau), land use, and location (fringe vs. interior) might influence these parameters. Land use in this study was identified as disturbance and restoration for all mangrove forests sampled in Palau and Vietnam, respectively. Vertical accretion rates were significantly greater in Vietnam (2.44 +/- A 1.38 cm/year) than Palau mangrove forests (0.47 +/- A 0.08 cm/year; p < 0.001, F-1,F-17 = 24.96). Vertical accretion rates were positively correlated to diversity (R = 0.43, p < 0.05). However, stronger correlations of accretion to bulk density (R = 0.64, p < 0.01) and significantly higher bulk densities in Vietnamese (0.67 +/- A 0.04 g/cm(3)) than Palau mangroves (0.30 +/- A 0.03 g/cm(3); p < 0.001, F-1,F-17 = 54.4) suggests that suspended sediments played a greater role in mangrove forest floor maintenance relative to sea level rise. Average vertical accretion rates were similar between naturally colonized (1.01 +/- A 0.10 cm/year) and outplanted sites (1.06 +/- A 0.05 cm/year) and between fringe (1.06 +/- A 0.12 cm/year) and interior mangrove (0.99 +/- A 0.09 cm/year) in Vietnam. In Palau, vertical accretion rates did not differ between disturbed (0.42 +/- A 0.11 cm/year) and undisturbed (0.51 +/- A 0.13 cm/year) mangrove forests and were higher in fringe (0.61 +/- A 0.15 cm/year) than interior sites (0.33 +/- A 0.09 cm/year; p = 0.1, F-1,F-7 = 3.45). Belowground C accumulation rates did not differ between any factors examined. C accumulation rates (69-602 gC/m(2)/year) were similar to those reported elsewhere in the literature and suggest that intact coastal ecosystems play an important role in the global C cycle, sequestering C at rates that are 10-20x greater than upland forests. Assuming vertical accretion rates measured using Pb-210 are an effective proxy for surface elevation, the Vietnamese and Palauan mangroves appear to be keeping up with current rates of sea level rise.";"2";"WOS:000374592800011";2016;"servic, restor, mangrov, coastal, habitat";0.724945503929856;133
"Reforming the EU approach to LULUCF and the climate policy framework";"Ellison, D
   Lundblad, M
   Petersson, H";"We focus on recent progress in reforming the role of forests and other land use in the EU climate policy framework. EU inclusion of LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry) in the climate policy framework still lags international developments, remaining at odds even with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) Kyoto framework. Though the EU has made some important changes that eclipse even the UNFCCC framework-in particular regarding the inclusion of cropland and grazing land management in mandatory EU-level carbon accounting practices-in other respects the EU has far to go. As part of a strategy for fulfilling emission reduction commitments within the EU burden-sharing agreement, Member states are not permitted to trade either in domestically nor foreign produced forest-based carbon credits. On the other hand, both the EU and the UNFCCC/Kyoto LULUCF frameworks remain distant from an idealized model that could facilitate increased climate change mitigation and a more efficient and balanced use of forest-based resources. Limiting the incorporation of forests in the climate policy framework has significant consequences for the cost and rapidity of emission reductions. Forest potential thus remains under-mobilized for climate change mitigation. In this context, we draw particular attention to the fact that forest-based carbon sequestration's potential contribution to negative emissions represents an important missed opportunity. In the context of ongoing discussions over the EU and UNFCCC's Post-Kyoto frameworks, we propose an all-encompassing LULUCF carbon accounting model incorporating all previously omitted carbon pools and activities, thus weighing LULUCF removals and emissions on a par with emissions from other sectors (industry, the energy sector, end-users). The successful integration of LULUCF into the EU climate policy and carbon-trading frameworks could dovetail neatly with emerging international climate change mitigation efforts.

   Alig, RJ";"We provide new cost estimates for carbon sequestration through afforestation in the U.S. We extend existing studies of carbon sequestration costs in several important ways, while ensuring the transparency of our approach. Our costs estimates have five distinguishing features: (1) we estimate costs for each county in the contiguous U.S., (2) we include afforestation of rangeland, in addition to cropland and pasture, (3) our opportunity cost estimates account for capitalized returns to future development (including associated option values) in addition to returns to agricultural production, (4) we develop a new set of forest establishment costs for each county, and (5) we incorporate data on Holdridge life zones to limit afforestation in locations where temperature and moisture availability prohibit forest growth. We find that at a carbon price of $50/ton, approximately 200 million tons of carbon would be sequestered annually through afforestation. At a price of $100/ton, an additional 100 million tons of carbon would be sequestered each year.

   Peters, GP";"Expanding high-elevation and high-latitude forest has contrasting climate feedbacks through carbon sequestration (cooling) and reduced surface reflectance (warming), which are yet poorly quantified. Here, we present an empirically based projection of mountain birch forest expansion in south-central Norway under climate change and absence of land use. Climate effects of carbon sequestration and albedo change are compared using four emission metrics. Forest expansion was modeled for a projected 2.6 degrees C increase in summer temperature in 2100, with associated reduced snow cover. We find that the current (year 2000) forest line of the region is circa 100 m lower than its climatic potential due to land-use history. In the future scenarios, forest cover increased from 12% to 27% between 2000 and 2100, resulting in a 59% increase in biomass carbon storage and an albedo change from 0.46 to 0.30. Forest expansion in 2100 was behind its climatic potential, forest migration rates being the primary limiting factor. In 2100, the warming caused by lower albedo from expanding forest was 10 to 17 times stronger than the cooling effect from carbon sequestration for all emission metrics considered. Reduced snow cover further exacerbated the net warming feedback. The warming effect is considerably stronger than previously reported for boreal forest cover, because of the typically low biomass density in mountain forests and the large changes in albedo of snow-covered tundra areas. The positive climate feedback of high-latitude and high-elevation expanding forests with seasonal snow cover exceeds those of afforestation at lower elevation, and calls for further attention of both modelers and empiricists. The inclusion and upscaling of these climate feedbacks from mountain forests into global models is warranted to assess the potential global impacts.";"11";"WOS:000337680700028";2014;"forest, reforest, china, tropic, deforest";0.718673848892076;225

   Hokkanen, T";"Litter input drives dynamic soil models that are used to understand the flows and stocks of soil carbon. In estimation of above-ground litterfall, much of the uncertainty lies in the turnover rate of branches. The objective of this study was to develop a model for estimating the branch litterfall of Scots pine stands.
   Here the potential litterfall of branches was modelled as a function of tree diameter. First, the vertical biomass distribution of branches was predicted on the basis of branch biomass data collected from trees sampled in southern Finland. Second, to predict annual branch mortality and potential litterfall, this information was combined with data on measured changes in height of the crown base.
   Depending on stem dbh (diameter at breast height), the proportion of annual litterfall of branches from the total biomass of branches varied from 6% to 0.5%, being highest in small trees. According to the results of this study, the litterfall of branches depends on tree size and stocking density. When the estimates were tested against data on collection of branch litter, it was found that the method underestimates litterfall in very old stands but agrees with the measurements in other stands.
   Application of this model to rates of branch litter production improves the accuracy of the estimated litter input to the dynamic soil model, therefore also improving the precision of soil carbon estimates.

In addition, gaps between scientific understandings of land degradation and international policy regimes are problematic.

Using a political ecology frame across disciplines, scales of inquiry, and regional experiences, we nuance the often polarized scientific debate while seeking to bridge the gap between science and policy. Three main findings emerge: State-led rural reforms in China represent an important approach to land degradation; a renewed focus on agriculture and sustainability in development discourses opens new ways for tackling nutrient depletion with combined sociotechnological reforms; and a policy void in Africa paves the way for market mechanisms, such as payment for environmental services, that are insufficiently understood and put fairness at risk.";"15";"WOS:000299610900012";2011;"polici, market, protocol, kyoto, intern";0.714339613235602;163

This article summarizes three feasible, efficient and environmentally sound alternatives for achieving the integration of such temporary credits in the European emissions trading market starting in 2008. The first proposal integrates tCERs and ICERs (temporary credits) into the EU ETS by allowing for their direct use for compliance purposes. The second proposal builds on the idea of swapping temporary credits for EU allowances (EUAs) by Member States. The third proposal would not require a political decision at the EU level. Instead supportive Member States or private carbon fund operators would agree to swap temporary credits for the CERs or ERUs they hold in their accounts. All three solutions would be linked to a risk-mitigation strategy based on levying a fee or fixing an exchange rate, which would allow governments to hedge the risk of losing temporary credits.";"5";"WOS:000232893300005";2005;"polici, market, protocol, kyoto, intern";0.712667049742943;163

In Australia, they are currently one of the most common forms of reforestation. Investment in establishing and maintaining such plantings relies on having a cost-effective modelling approach to providing unbiased estimates of biomass production and carbon sequestration rates. In Australia, the Full Carbon Accounting Model (FulICAM) is used for both national greenhouse gas accounting and project-scale sequestration activities. Prior to undertaking the work presented here, the FulICAM tree growth curve was not calibrated specifically for environmental plantings and generally under-estimated their biomass. Here we collected and analysed above-ground biomass data from 605 mixed-species environmental plantings, and tested the effects of several planting characteristics on growth rates. Plantings were then categorised based on significant differences in growth rates. Growth of plantings differed between temperate and tropical regions. Tropical plantings were relatively uniform in terms of planting methods and their growth was largely related to stand age, consistent with the un-calibrated growth curve. However, in temperate regions where plantings were more variable, key factors influencing growth were planting width, stand density and species-mix (proportion of individuals that were trees). These categories provided the basis for FulICAM calibration. Although the overall model efficiency was only 39-46%, there was nonetheless no significant bias when the model was applied to the various planting categories. Thus, modelled estimates of biomass accumulation will be reliable on average, but estimates at any particular location will be uncertain, with either under- or over-prediction possible. When compared with the un-calibrated yield curves, predictions using the new calibrations show that early growth is likely to be more rapid and total above-ground biomass may be higher for many plantings at maturity. This study has considerably improved understanding of the patterns of growth in different types of environmental plantings, and in modelling biomass accumulation in young (<25 years old) plantings. However, significant challenges remain to understand longer-term stand dynamics, particularly with temporal changes in stand density and species composition.

Topics have included the initial taboo on bringing the discussion of climate engineering into the open, guidelines to put in place before commencing research, and governance arrangements before first deployment. While this work is clearly important, the current paper considers what insights can be gleaned from considering the tail-end, that is, by using the requirement for future cessation as a criterion for any acceptable climate engineering strategy. After showing that time-limited interventions are a key part of the rhetoric of leading climate engineering advocates, the paper examines the implications of imposing a 'cessation requirement' on solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal strategies. Consideration of a cessation requirement turns out to reveal a great deal about what ought to be happening now, before any decision to proceed with climate engineering deployment has been taken.";"2";"WOS:000369779700006";2016;"optim, terrestri, radiat, forc, centuri";0.710943076750358;114

This article investigates the opportunities and barriers to developing global experimentalist governance approaches in the international regulation of climate change technologies, focusing on the recent framework for marine geoengineering under the London Dumping Protocol. It argues that, in the face of the limits of international law in dealing with uncertainty, multilevel distribution of power and regulatory disconnection, global experimentalist governance is attractive to catalyse adaptability, iterative learning, participation and cooperation.

   Bizikova, L";"Climate change has become an important environmental policy issue. Numerous carbon sequestration policy initiatives, potential benefits of which in environmental, economic and social terms could be substantial, are directed toward both woodland expansion and using of wood as a substitute for fossil fuels. There is a great deal of uncertainty, however, on how to define sustainability of such policies in a broadly acceptable and efficient way; how to translate sustainability requirements into policy guidelines; how to overcome market limitations and where to place biomass production in the general context of land use where contemporary agricultural change will likely be influential. On the basis of several countries from Europe (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Slovakia, and Ukraine) this paper highlights social and economic problems of moderating carbon emissions through afforestation. It provides an indication of whether forestry can offer a socially acceptable and a low-cost opportunity for carbon uptake. The conclusion is that along with carbon sequestration potential, the level of land use integration and the stage of institutional development play important roles for effective implementation of climate policies. The necessity is then to link these policies with regional developments, and to back them up with adequate economic incentives, appropriate institutions and with public engagement in environmental decision-making.

   Halme, P";"Impaired natural ecosystems, such as agricultural lands, are restored toward original or other target stage. Because the long agricultural history has changed the physical, chemical and biological features of the soil, afforested fields can harbor novel species assemblages and interactions. Our overall aim was to quantify the diversity of ground beetles and ants in early successional afforested fields. In a large scale field experiment, we compared plots that had been afforested 25 years ago by planting monocultures of birch, pine or spruce trees. A total of 4080 carabid individuals representing 41 species, and 131,933 ant individuals representing 15 species were recorded. Both the carabid and ant assemblage included forest and open-habitat species, but were dominated by generalists, which is typical for early successional habitats. Tree species had a strong influence on carabid and ant assemblages. Species composition among pine plots was more homogeneous than among spruce or birch plots. The diversity of ground beetles and ants increased from pine to spruce to birch plots, most likely due to positive influence of leaf litter. Our results indicate that early successional afforested fields can harbor species rich arthro, pod assemblages. The diversity and species composition of these assemblages are influenced by tree species, already at early successional stages, and are likely to become more prominent as succession proceeds. Thus, the tree species used in afforestation is one important factor for consideration, if field afforestation has biodiversity objectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the impact of the establishment of hybrid poplar plantations on C and N storage and dynamics is poorly understood. We studied the distribution and temporal changes of C and N in soil organic matter (SOM) density fractions in 2-, 5-, 11-, and 13-year-old (age as in 2006) hybrid poplar stands that form a chronosequence by sampling the plantations in both 2004 and 2006. Sodium polytungstate (SPT, density = 1.6 g mL(-1)) was used to fractionate the soil into light (LF, density < 1.6 g mL(-1)), occluded light (LFo, density < 1.6 g mL(-1)) and heavy fractions (HF density > 1.6 g mL(-1)). The results showed that C and N concentrations (g kg(-1) of fraction) in the SOM density fractions decreased in the order of LFo>LF>HF, while the C/N ratio was in the order of LF>LFo>HF. The amount of C and N stored in the LF, LFo and HF fractions and bulk soil in the top 10 cm of soil was: 149-504, 70-336, 1380-2876 and 1617-3776 g m(-2), respectively, for C, and 6-26, 3-20, 149-271 and 152-299 g M, respectively, for N. From 2004 to 2006, C and N storage decreased in the LF and LFo fractions but increased in the HF fraction in the youngest stand. However, stand-age effects were likely muted by high inherent soil variability among the stands. Carbon storage in the light fraction was responsive in the short term to hybrid poplar plantation establishment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the increasing body of knowledge, mostly focused on microbial communities, scarce information is available on how geological CO2 affects mesofauna and microfauna, and their interactions. We studied microorganisms, microfauna i.e. protists and nematodes, and mesofauna communities, i.e. collembola and mites and their relationships in a natural CO2 vent at La Sima (Spain). Four CO2 flux intensities from Control (7-19 g m(-2) d(-1)) to low (40-55 g m(-2) d(-1)) and high fluxes (260-1600 g m(-2) d(-1)), including extreme emissions (more than 10(4) g m(-2) d(-1)) were studied. We found that increasing CO2 emissions from Control to high fluxes strongly affected biota abundances and richness, cascading from microorganisms to mesofauna, and resulting in reduced and less diverse populations in each of the groups levels assayed. Nevertheless, at extreme fluxes edaphic biota biomass recovered in most of the communities, suggesting that the extreme CO2 conditions are associated with high abundances of well adapted communities, although with very low diversity. Increases in abundance of bacteria, fungi and amoebae, but not ciliates, were related to increases in mesofauna richness and nematode and mesofauna abundances.

Including nitrogen (N)-fixing tree species may increase carbon (C) sequestration in mixed-species plantings, as these species may substantially increase soil C beneath them. We need to better understand the role of N-fixers in mixed-species plantings to potentially maximize soil C sequestration in these systems. Here, we present a field-based study that asked two specific questions related to the inclusion of N-fixing trees in a mixed-species planting: 1) Do non-N-fixing trees have access to N derived from fixation of atmospheric N-2 by neighbouring N-fixing trees? 2) Do soil microbial communities differ under N-fixing trees and non-N-fixing trees in a mixed-species restoration planting? We sampled leaves from the crowns, and litter and soils beneath the crowns of two N-fixing and two non-N-fixing tree species that dominated the planting. Using the N-15 natural abundance method, we found indications that fixed atmospheric N was utilized by the non-N-fixing trees, most likely through tight root connections or organic forms of N from the litter layer, rather than through the decomposition of N-fixers litter. While the two N-fixing tree species that were studied appeared to fix atmospheric N, they were substantially different in terms of C and N addition to the soil, as well as microbial community composition beneath them. This shows that the effect of N-fixing tree species on soil carbon sequestration is species-specific, cannot be generalized and requires planting trails to determine if there will be benefits to carbon sequestration.

"Life cycle analysis of biochemical cellulosic ethanol under multiple
   scenarios";"Murphy, CW
   Kendall, A";"Cellulosic ethanol is widely believed to offer substantial environmental advantages over petroleum fuels and grain-based ethanol, particularly in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. The environmental impacts of biofuels are largely caused by precombustion activities, feedstock production and conversion facility operations. Life cycle analysis (LCA) is required to understand these impacts. This article describes a field-to-blending terminal LCA of cellulosic ethanol produced by biochemical conversion (hydrolysis and fermentation) using corn stover or switchgrass as feedstock. This LCA develops unique models for most elements of the biofuel production process and assigns environmental impact to different phases of production. More than 30 scenarios are evaluated, reflecting a range of feedstock, technology and scale options for near-term and future facilities. Cellulosic ethanol, as modeled here, has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum-based liquid transportation fuels, though substantial uncertainty exists. Most of the conservative scenarios estimate GHG emissions of approximately 45-60g carbon dioxide equivalent per MJ of delivered fuel (g CO(2)eMJ(-1)) without credit for coproducts, and 20-30g CO(2)eMJ(-1) when coproducts are considered. Under most scenarios, feedstock production, grinding and transport dominate the total GHG footprint. The most optimistic scenarios include sequestration of carbon in soil and have GHG emissions below zero g CO(2)eMJ(-1), while the most pessimistic have life-cycle GHG emissions higher than petroleum gasoline. Soil carbon changes are the greatest source of uncertainty, dominating all other sources of GHG emissions at the upper bound of their uncertainty. Many LCAs of biofuels are narrowly constrained to GHG emissions and energy; however, these narrow assessments may miss important environmental impacts. To ensure a more holistic assessment of environmental performance, a complete life cycle inventory, with over 1100 tracked material and energy flows for each scenario is provided in the online supplementary material for this article.";"7";"WOS:000359384500009";2015;"ghg, bioenergi, biofuel, energi, life";0.690802757597007;85

"Sequestration through forestry and agriculture";"Conant, RT";"Current climate mitigation policies have not fully resolved contentious issues regarding the inclusion of carbon sequestration through changes in forestry and agricultural management practices. Terrestrial carbon sinks could be a low-cost mitigation option that fosters conservation and development, yet issues related to accurately documenting the amount of carbon sequestered undermine confidence that emission offsets through sequestration are equivalent to emission reductions. From an atmospheric perspective, net of CO2 removals through sequestration are equivalent to emission reductions over a given period of time. But carbon will not remain sequestered in biomass or soils indefinitely and investments in sequestration could stifle investments in reducing emissions from other sources. Many international climate agreements cap emissions from some countries or sectors but enable participation of uncapped countries or sectors for forestry and agricultural sequestration. This structure can prompt emission increases in parts of the uncapped entities that weaken the value of emission reductions earned through sequestration. This has been a minor issue under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. Reduced emissions through deforestation and degradation is susceptible to the same problems. The purpose of this article is to review the science, politics, and policy that form the basis of arguments for and against the inclusion forestry and agricultural sequestration as a component of current and future international climate mitigation policies.

Separate experimental plots, 1 m 2, were established in nitrogen fertilized no-tilled native grassland and tilled soils with and without fungicide application. Two studies were conducted. The first study was initiated in June 1999 and lasted for 1 year with monthly flux measurements from tilled and no-till soils. The second study commenced in August 2001 with twelve weekly measurements from tilled soils only. From both studies mancozeb suppressed emissions of CO2 and N2O in the tilled soil by an average of 28% and 47%, respectively. This suppression corresponded with efficacy periods of 14-29 and 56-77 days, respectively. From the no-till soils mancozeb decreased CO2 and N2O emissions by 33% and 80% for periods of 29 and 94 days, respectively. Mancozeb inhibited CH4 consumption in the first study by 46% and 71% in the tilled and no-till soil for periods of 8 and 29 days, respectively, but had no effect in the second study. From both studies chlorothalonil initially suppressed CO2 and N2O emissions and enhanced CH4 uptake in the tilled soil by an average of 37%, 40%, and 115%, respectively. These effects corresponded with efficacy periods of 14-29, 21 - 56, and 1 - 14 days, respectively. In the no-till soil chlorothalonil inhibited CO2 and N2O emissions and enhanced CH4 uptake by 29%, 48%, and 86% for periods of 29, 56, and 56 days, respectively. Following the initial period of suppression, chlorothalonil subsequently enhanced N2O emissions in the tilled soil by an average of 51% and in the no-till soil by 81% before returning to near background levels. The beginning of increased N2O emissions from the chlorothalonil-amended plots corresponded with a maximum soil concentration of the chlorothalonil degradate, 4-hydroxy-2, 5, 6-trichloroisophthalonitrile. The site specific global warming potential (GWP) resulting from the fluxes of CO2, N2O, and CH4 from all soils was determined to decrease by an average 26% and 21% as a result of a single application of mancozeb or chlorothalonil, respectively. The decrease in CO2 emissions in the fungicide-amended plots potentially could result in the conservation of as much as 1200 and 2400 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) organic carbon in the tilled and no-till plots, respectively. Therefore it is feasible that application of certain fungicides to agricultural soil might lead to enhanced soil carbon sequestration and thus have additional positive effects on atmospheric CO2 concentrations.";"7";"WOS:000220224900001";2004;"ha1, n2o, yr1, pastur, flux";0.684166941995981;104
"Stratospheric solar geoengineering without ozone loss";"Keith, DW
   Weisenstein, DK
   Dykema, JA
   Keutsch, FN";"Injecting sulfate aerosol into the stratosphere, the most frequently analyzed proposal for solar geoengineering, may reduce some climate risks, but it would also entail new risks, including ozone loss and heating of the lower tropical stratosphere, which, in turn, would increase water vapor concentration causing additional ozone loss and surface warming. We propose a method for stratospheric aerosol climate modification that uses a solid aerosol composed of alkaline metal salts that will convert hydrogen halides and nitric and sulfuric acids into stable salts to enable stratospheric geoengineering while reducing or reversing ozone depletion. Rather than minimizing reactive effects by reducing surface area using high refractive index materials, this method tailors the chemical reactivity. Specifically, we calculate that injection of calcite (CaCO3) aerosol particles might reduce net radiative forcing while simultaneously increasing column ozone toward its preanthropogenic baseline. A radiative forcing of -1 W.m(-2), for example, might be achieved with a simultaneous 3.8% increase in column ozone using 2.1 Tg.y(-1) of 275-nm radius calcite aerosol. Moreover, the radiative heating of the lower stratosphere would be roughly 10-fold less than if that same radiative forcing had been produced using sulfate aerosol. Although solar geoengineering cannot substitute for emissions cuts, it may supplement them by reducing some of the risks of climate change. Further research on this and similar methods could lead to reductions in risks and improved efficacy of solar geoengineering methods.";"0";"WOS:000391090800025";2016;"optim, terrestri, radiat, forc, centuri";0.683338217923958;114

Despite its importance to crop yield, the role of phosphorus (P) with respect to ecological stoichiometry and soil C sequestration in paddy fields remains poorly understood, which limits our ability to predict nutrient-related soil C cycling. Here, we collected soil samples from a paddy field experiment after seven years of superphosphate application along a gradient of 0, 30, 60, and 90 (P-0 through P-90, respectively) kg P.ha(-1).yr(-1) in order to evaluate the role of exogenous P on soil C sequestration through regulating microbial stoichiometry. P fertilization increased soil total organic C and labile organic C by 1-14% and 4-96%, respectively, while rice yield is a function of the activities of soil beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG), acid phosphatase (AP), and the level of available soil P through a stepwise linear regression model. P input induced C limitation, as reflected by decreases in the ratios of C: P in soil and microbial biomass. An eco-enzymatic ratio indicating microbial investment in C vs. P acquisition, i.e., ln(BG) : ln(AP), changed the ecological function of microbial C acquisition, and was stoichiometrically related to P input. This mechanism drove a shift in soil resource availability by increasing bacterial community richness and diversity, and stimulated soil C sequestration in the paddy field by enhancing C-degradation-related bacteria for the breakdown of plant-derived carbon sources. Therefore, the decline in the C: P stoichiometric ratio of soil microorganism biomass under P input was beneficial for soil C sequestration, which offered a \"win-win\" relationship for the maximum balance point between C sequestration and P availability for rice production in the face of climate change.";"0";"WOS:000351849700025";2015;"communiti, microbi, dri, abund, group";0.682016586462173;89

"CO2 reduction potentials by utilizing waste plastics in steel works";"Sekine, Y

   Matsuno, Y";"Feedstock recycling has received attention as an effective method to recycle waste plastics. However, estimating the reduction potential by life cycle assessment using coke oven and blast furnace in steel works has been a challenging task due to the complex structure of energy flow in steel works. Municipal waste plastics consist of several plastic resins. Previous studies have generally disregarded the composition of waste plastics, which varies significantly depending on the geographical area. If the reduction potentials by using each plastic resin in steel works can be quantified, the potential of municipal waste plastics (mixtures of plastic resins) can be estimated by summing up the potential of each resin multiplied by the composition of each resin in municipal waste plastics. Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate the reduction potentials of CO2 emissions by using individual plastic resins (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) and those for municipal waste plastics in the coke oven and blast furnace.
   A model was developed to clarify the energy flow in steel works. In order to estimate the changes in energy and material balance in coke ovens when waste plastics are charged, the equations to calculate the coke product yield, gas product yield, and oil product yields of each plastic resin were derived from previous studies. The Rist model was adopted to quantify the changes in the inputs and outputs when plastics were fed into a blast furnace. Then, a matrix calculation method was used to calculate the change in energy balance before and after plastics are fed into a coke oven.
   It was confirmed that product yields of municipal waste plastics (mixtures of plastic resins) could be estimated by summing up the product yield of each plastic resin multiplied by the composition of each resin in municipal waste plastics. In both cases of coke oven and blast furnace feedstock recycling, the reduction potential of CO2 emissions varies significantly depending on the plastic resins. For example, in the case of coke oven chemical feedstock recycling, the reduction potential of PS and PP is larger than that of PE. On the other hand, in the case of blast furnace feedstock recycling, PE has the largest CO2 emissions reduction potential, whereas the CO2 emission reduction potential of PP is smaller than those of PE and PS. In both cases, PET has negative CO2 emission reduction potentials, i.e., there is an increase of CO2 emissions. In addition, the reduction potentials of CO2 emissions are slightly different in each city.
   The differences in the reduction potentials of CO2 emissions by coke oven chemical feedstock recycling of each plastic resin is attributable to the differences in calorific values and coke product yields of each plastic resin. On the other hand, the difference in the CO2 emission reduction potential for each plastic resin in blast furnace feedstock recycling is attributable to the difference in calorific values and the carbon and hydrogen content of each plastic resin, which leads to a difference in the coke substitution effect by each plastic resin. In both cases, the difference in those of municipal waste plastics is mostly attributable to the amount of impurities (e.g., ash, water) in the municipal waste plastics.
   It was found that the reduction potential of CO2 emissions by coke oven and blast furnace feedstock recycling of municipal waste plastics (mixtures of plastic resins) could be estimated by summing up the potential of each resin multiplied by the composition of each resin in municipal waste plastics. It was also clarified that feedstock recycling of waste plastic in steel works is effective for avoiding the increase in CO2 emissions by incinerating waste plastics, such as those from household mixtures of different resins.
   With the results obtained in this study, reduction potentials of CO2 emissions can be calculated for any waste plastics because differences in composition are taken into account.";"13";"WOS:000263982300005";2009;"ghg, bioenergi, biofuel, energi, life";0.681060765704573;85

   change and global warming: Implications for coral reefs";"Crabbe, MJC";"Climate change will have serious effects on the planet and on its ecosystems. Currently, mitigation efforts are proving ineffectual in reducing anthropogenic CO(2) emissions. Coral reefs are the most sensitive ecosystems on the planet to climate change, and here we review modelling a number of geoengineering options. and their potential influence on coral reefs. There are two categories of geoengineering, short-wave solar radiation management and longwave carbon dioxide removal. The first set of techniques only reduce some, but not all, effects of climate change. while possibly creating other problems. They also do not affect CO(2) levels and therefore fail to address the wider effects of rising CO(2), including ocean acidification, important for coral reefs. Solar radiation is important to coral growth and survival, and solar radiation management is no in general appropriate for this ecosystem. Longwave carbon dioxide removal techniques address the root cause of climate change, rising CO(2) concentrations. they have relatively low uncertainties and risks.

To estimate all greenhouse gas (GHG) exchanges associated with various agricultural systems, life cycle assessments (LCAs) are frequently undertaken. To date LCA practitioners have not had a well-defined procedure to account for soil C in their assessments and as a consequence it is often not included. In this study, various methods used to estimate soil C changes due to (i) LMC and (ii) LUC are examined to assess soil C accounting methodologies in the life cycle inventory (LCI) of agricultural LCAs. A compromise between accuracy and completeness in LCA methods is necessary. A ranking of the preference of soil C accounting methods is suggested based on user expertise and data quality. For large scale assessment, the timing of soil CO2 emissions should be taken into account. If indirect LUC is relevant, a sensitivity analysis of assessment methods should be conducted because the methods highly affect assessment results. A common soil C accounting method that can be easily applied in agricultural LCA needs to be established and an agreement on indirect LUC methods will facilitate the assessment of LMC and LUC within agricultural LCAs.

Using both manual and automatic sampling chambers, we measured N(2)O and CH(4) fluxes at a long-term experimental site (1968-present) in Queensland, Australia from 2006 to 2009. Annual net greenhouse gas fluxes (NGGF) were calculated from the 3-year mean N(2)O and CH(4) fluxes and the long-term soil organic carbon changes. N(2)O emissions exhibited clear daily, seasonal and interannual variations, highlighting the importance of whole-year measurement over multiple years for obtaining temporally representative annual emissions. Averaged over 3 years, annual N(2)O emissions from the unfertilized and fertilized soils (90 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as urea) amounted to 138 and 902 g N ha(-1), respectively. The average annual N(2)O emissions from the fertilized soil were 388 g N ha(-1) lower under no-till (NT) than under conventional tillage (CT) and 259 g N ha(-1) higher under stubble retention (SR) than under stubble burning (SB). Annual N(2)O emissions from the unfertilized soil were similar between the contrasting tillage and stubble management practices. The average emission factors of fertilizer N were 0.91%, 1.20%, 0.52% and 0.77% for the CT-SB, CT-SR, NT-SB and NT-SR treatments, respectively. Annual CH(4) fluxes from the soil were very small (-200-300 g CH(4) ha(-1) yr(-1)) with no significant difference between treatments. The NGGF were 277-350 kg CO(2)-e ha(-1) yr(-1) for the unfertilized treatments and 401-710 kg CO(2)-e ha(-1) yr(-1) for the fertilized treatments. Among the fertilized treatments, N(2)O emissions accounted for 52-97% of NGGF and NT-SR resulted in the lowest NGGF (401 kg CO(2)-e ha(-1) yr(-1) or 140 kg CO(2)-e t(-1) grain). Therefore, NT-SR with improved N fertilizer management practices was considered the most promising management regime for simultaneously achieving maximal yield and minimal NGGF.";"50";"WOS:000294571700007";2011;"ha1, n2o, yr1, pastur, flux";0.67878722170409;104
"Regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide by vegetation fires";"Ball, R";"Vegetation fires release some fraction of the carbon in the biomass back to the atmosphere as CO2 and deposit some of the carbon onto the ground as charcoal or pyrogenic carbon. It is an open, but not unanswerable, question as to whether the formation of pyrogenic carbon can effectively sequester carbon from atmospheric CO2. The purpose of this article is to conceptualise the question in terms of the global Charcoal Challenges, which deal with the scientific and socio economic questions associated with increasing the refractory (or long-term) black carbon pool at the expense of the atmospheric carbon pool, and to investigate the formation and decay of charcoal within this paradigm. Three particular Charcoal Challenges are examined: (1) the feasibility of lowering atmospheric CO2 by biochar production, (2) the tension between nature's use of fire to distribute carbon between long-term black carbon and short-term atmospheric pools and humans' need to suppress fire and (3) the premise that black carbon is a sink for CO2 only if its rate of formation exceeds its rate of decay; otherwise, it is a source. I show how the thermal decomposition of cellulose, the major constituent of vegetation, during fires acts as a thermokinetic oscillator that regulates the global distribution of carbon between atmospheric and black carbon reservoirs. I conclude that we cannot yet assume with certainty that the global black carbon reservoir is a carbon sink.";"1";"WOS:000333958300004";2014;"degre, stabil, char, charcoal, decomposit";0.677837070017323;92

Then, 82 different land uses (21 small-scale woodlots, 35 homesteads and 26 boundary plantings) which were older than 15 years and established by the current owner were selected for the financial analysis. The input and output data were filled in a data sheet by face-to-face interview with the owners. The results showed that small-scale woodlot is the most profitable agroforestry practice followed by boundary plantings and homesteads. An ex-ante analysis of implementing the agroforestry practices showed that with minimum land area allocated for the practices, a household can generate net discounted revenues ranging from 5,908 to 26,021 Ethiopian Birr (532-2,342 USD) in 15 years at 10 % interest rate. Hence, the expansion of such agroforestry practices has a vital effect on farm household's income. Lack of proper planning and poor in-depth understanding about roles of trees and shrubs for household's income, land and seedling shortage, financial constraints and labor scarcity were identified as major problems for the expansion of agroforestry practices in the area. A thorough extension service comprising both efficient land resources utilization and proper planning practices could enhance the expansion of agroforestry practices and thereby positively influence the farmer's livelihood.";"2";"WOS:000314270400018";2013;"farm, biodivers, food, agroforestri, program";0.676507281249895;94
"Gross Direct and Embodied Carbon Sinks for Urban Inventories";"Mohareb, E
   Kennedy, C";"Cities and urban regions are undertaking efforts to quantify greenhouse (GHG) emissions from their jurisdictional boundaries. Although inventorying methodologies are beginning to standardize for GHG sources, carbon sequestration is generally not quantified. This article describes the methodology and quantification of gross urban carbon sinks. Sinks are categorized into direct and embodied sinks. Direct sinks generally incorporate natural process, such as humification in soils and photosynthetic biomass growth (in urban trees, perennial crops, and regional forests). Embodied sinks include activities associated with consumptive behavior that result in the import and/or storage of carbon, such as landfilling of waste, concrete construction, and utilization of durable wood products. Using methodologies based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006 guidelines (for direct sinks) and peer-reviewed literature (for embodied sinks), carbon sequestration for 2005 is calculated for the Greater Toronto Area. Direct sinks are found to be 317 kilotons of carbon (kt C), and are dominated by regional forest biomass. Embodied sinks are calculated to be 234 kt C based on one year's consumption, though a complete life cycle accounting of emissions would likely transform this sum from a carbon sink to a source. There is considerable uncertainty associated with the methodologies used, which could be addressed with city-specific stock-change measurements. Further options for enhancing carbon sink capacity within urban environments are explored, such as urban biomass growth and carbon capture and storage.";"4";"WOS:000304809500005";2012;"ghg, bioenergi, biofuel, energi, life";0.671240522762938;85

Here, we examined straw-derived charcoal in an ancient paddy soil dated from similar to 3700 calendar year before present (cal. year bp). Analytical results showed that soil organic matter consisted of more than 25 % of charcoal in charcoal-rich layer. Similarities in morphology and molecular structure between the ancient and the fresh rice-straw-derived charcoal indicated that ancient charcoal was derived from rice straw. The lower carbon content, higher oxygen content, and obvious carbonyl of the ancient charcoal compared with fresh rice straw charcoal implied that oxidation occurred in the scale of thousands years. However, the dominant aromatic C of ancient charcoal indicated that rice-straw-derived charcoal was highly stable in the buried paddy soil due to its intrinsic chemical structures and the physical protection of ancient paddy wetland. Therefore, it may suggest that straw charcoal application is a potential pathway for C sequestration considering its longevity.";"1";"WOS:000368200200007";2016;"degre, stabil, char, charcoal, decomposit";0.669455020158994;92

The average daily CO2 fluxes differed significantly amongst various treatments and were 55, 26 and 92% higher in NPK, N and NPK + FYM treatments over the control in the maize crop season and 43, 8 and 83% in the wheat crop season. Highly significant correlation of CO2 emissions was found with soil organic carbon and total nitrogen in the maize and the wheat crop seasons. Although, CO2 emissions were higher from long-term inorganic fertilizers and FYM treatments, still they are environmentally sustainable management practices, as they increased soil fertility and crop yields which consequently resulted in higher atmospheric CO2 capture by plants and carbon sequestration in soils.";"0";"WOS:000377633900001";2016;"treatment, residu, miner, rice, straw";0.667786092758744;89

Developing and judiciously administering such therapies will require biomarker panels to identify early AD pathology, classify disease stage, monitor pathological progression, and predict cognitive decline. To discover such biomarkers, we measured AD-associated changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome.
   Methods and Findings: CSF samples from individuals with mild AD (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 1) (n = 24) and cognitively normal controls (CDR 0) (n = 24) were subjected to two-dimensional difference-in-gel electrophoresis. Within 119 differentially-abundant gel features, mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identified 47 proteins. For validation, eleven proteins were re-evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Six of these assays (NrCAM, YKL-40, chromogranin A, carnosinase I, transthyretin, cystatin C) distinguished CDR 1 and CDR 0 groups and were subsequently applied (with tau, p-tau181 and A beta 42 ELISAs) to a larger independent cohort (n = 292) that included individuals with very mild dementia (CDR 0.5). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses using stepwise logistic regression yielded optimal biomarker combinations to distinguish CDR 0 from CDR. 0 (tau, YKL-40, NrCAM) and CDR 1 from CDR, 1 (tau, chromogranin A, carnosinase I) with areas under the curve of 0.90 (0.85-0.94 95% confidence interval [CI]) and 0.88 (0.81-0.94 CI), respectively.
   Conclusions: Four novel CSF biomarkers for AD (NrCAM, YKL-40, chromogranin A, carnosinase I) can improve the diagnostic accuracy of A beta 42 and tau. Together, these six markers describe six clinicopathological stages from cognitive normalcy to mild dementia, including stages defined by increased risk of cognitive decline. Such a panel might improve clinical trial efficiency by guiding subject enrollment and monitoring disease progression. Further studies will be required to validate this panel and evaluate its potential for distinguishing AD from other dementing conditions.";"84";"WOS:000286514300004";2011;"harvest, rotat, wood, simul, ton";0.667582853998491;53

The aim of this study was to investigate the links between zero tillage practices and the functioning of the soil microbial community with regards to C cycling, testing the hypothesis that zero tillage enhances biological functioning in soil with positive implications for C sequestration. Specifically, we determined microbial respiration rates, enzyme activities, carbon source utilization and the functional chemistry of the soil organic matter in temperate well drained soils that had been zero tilled for seven years against annually tilled soils. Zero tilled soils contained 9% more soil C, 30% higher microbial biomass C than tilled soil and an increased presence of aromatic functional groups indicating greater preservation of recalcitrant C. Greater CO2 emission and higher respirational quotients were observed from tilled soils compared to zero tilled soils while microbial biomass was 30% greater in zero tilled soils indicating a more efficient functioning of the microbial community under zero tillage practice. Furthermore, microbial enzyme activities of dehydrogenase, cellulase, xylanase, beta-glucosidase, phenol oxidase and peroxidase were higher in zero tilled soils. Considering zero tillage enhanced both microbial functioning and C storage in soil, we suggest that it offers significant promise to improve soil health and support mitigation measures against climate change.

"Human impacts on soil properties and their implications for the
   sensitivity of soil systems in Scotland";"Grieve, IC";"Human activities have had pronounced impacts on soil properties. Conifer afforestation in the uplands has caused significant decreases in soil pH and in the quality and turnover of organic matter. Acid deposition has increased soil acidity by a similar amount to conifer afforestation but has been shown to affect soils at greater depths. Acid deposition has also increased the mobility of trace metals in the soil and therefore increased metal concentrations in drainage waters. Applications of sewage sludge to the soil have been shown to increase metal concentrations, although most of the Scottish soils affected have high trace metal binding capacities. Intensification of arable cultivation in the lowlands has reduced organic matter concentrations, structural stability and soil workability, and has had effects on soil erodibility. Human trampling, while highly localised, affects sensitive mountain soils in popular areas, leading to loss of surface organic horizons, and therefore, carbon storage. The future impacts of human activities on the soil may be exacerbated by changing climate, and the need to monitor and predict these will not diminish. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Based on participant observations and interviews with small-scale farmers in western Kenya, we explore and theorise agroforestry adoption as a process of socio-ecological and socio-technological change. Proceeding from sustainability science and a modified livelihoods approach we use grounded theory in narrative walks' to analyse adoption and non-adoption of agroforestry in a setting where farmers continuously interpret, adjust to and invest in their environment. Given the diversity and complexity of such livelihoods, the analysis is structured around reproductive and productive chains, strategies and practices defined by uncertainty and risk, and conflicting interests. Findings indicate that food secure farmers may act as entrepreneurially inclined opportunity seekers' and venture into agroforestry, whereas the food imperative'(alongside the health imperative') makes it more difficult for agroforestry to take root among the poorest of the poor' who act as risk evaders'. Hence, agroforestry adoption must be understood within an integrated human-environment frame recognising the socio-ecological relations of technology adoption and the wider political aspects and power structures of food security.";"4";"WOS:000332060400001";2014;"farm, biodivers, food, agroforestri, program";0.665097733017366;94

We synthesized the results from 292 sites and carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate the dynamics of soil C and N stocks following afforestation. Changes in soil C and N stocks were significantly correlated and had a similar temporal pattern. Significant C and N stock increases were found 30 and 50 yr after afforestation, respectively. Before these time points, C and N stocks were either depleted or unchanged. Carbon stock increased following afforestation on cropland and pasture, and in tropical, subtropical and boreal zones. The soil N stock increased in the subtropical zone. The soil C stock increased after afforestation with hardwoods such as Eucalyptus, but did not change after afforestation with softwoods such as pine. Soil N stocks increased and decreased, respectively, after afforestation with hardwoods (excluding Eucalyptus) and pine. These results indicate that soil C and N stocks both increase with time after afforestation, and that C sequestration through afforestation depends on prior land use, climate and the tree species planted.";"80";"WOS:000304448500020";2012;"afforest, plantat, stock, pine, layer";0.664170105989412;123

Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)-N(2) surface area (SA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), synchrotron-based near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy are used to show how two plant materials (wood and grass) undergo analogous but quantitatively different physical-chemical transitions as charring temperature increases from 100 to 700 degrees C. These changes suggest the existence of four distinct categories of char consisting of a unique mixture of chemical phases and physical states: (i) in transition chars,the crystalline character of the precursor materials is preserved; (ii) in amorphous chars, the heat-altered molecules and incipient aromatic polycondensates are randomly mixed; (iii) composite chars consist of poorly ordered graphene stacks embedded in amorphous phases; and (iv) turbostratic chars are dominated by disordered graphitic crystallites.

"Social and environmental impacts of payments for environmental services
   for agroforestry on small-scale farms in southern Costa Rica";"Cole, RJ";"Agroforestry on small-scale farms has potential to provide important ecological services, such as carbon sequestration and maintenance of biological diversity, while also providing on-farm products for domestic use and marketing. Payments for environmental services (PES) are an increasingly popular mechanism for encouraging production of ecological services on agricultural lands and may also contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable farming practices through adoption of new farming technologies. There is little current information, however, on the degree to which PES increase tree planting relative to a baseline or the effects of program participation on farmer livelihoods. This study examined the initial impacts of a recent PES program for agroforestry in southern Costa Rica by: (1) assessing the efficiency of PES in increasing reforestation relative to baseline tree planting activities; (2) examining farmer perceptions of socioeconomic and environmental impacts of PES; and (3) exploring obstacles to adoption of agroforestry practices. Thirty-six participant and non-participant farmers were given semi-structured interviews. Key informant interviews were conducted with forestry engineers, farmers' associations, NGOs, and government agencies. Farmers reported positive economic benefits in the first 2-3 years of program participation. PES participants also planted substantially more trees and more species than non-participant farmers. The PES program was effective in overcoming initial economic and technical obstacles that made adoption of agroforestry unattractive. Strong local organizations played a key role in facilitating adoption. Additional investment in short- to medium-term technical support will likely be necessary for broad retention of agroforestry practices beyond the life of the PES contracts.";"9";"WOS:000277755300003";2010;"farm, biodivers, food, agroforestri, program";0.660795622005345;94

Forestry mitigation is introduced into the model relying on carbon sequestration curves provided by a global forestry model. The structure of the original CGE is extended to consider land use change and timber supply effects, resulting from the use of forest sinks to reduce carbon emissions. Results show that afforestation and timber management could lead to substantially lower policy costs. By using forest-carbon sinks it is possible to achieve the 30% emissions reduction target with an additional European effort of only 0.2% of GDP compared with the cost of a 20% emissions reduction without forestry. Carbon price is also reduced, by approximately 30% in 2020. European forest-carbon sequestration may have, however, the perverse effect of increasing timber production in areas of the world which already have high deforestation rates.

More information is required about how afforestation affects carbon storage, especially in the soil. We report a study in which soil carbon storage in first-rotation Mediterranean Pinus radiata plantations, established on former cereal fields and vineyards, was measured and modelled. Measurements were made on plantations of several ages, as well as repeat measurements at the same site after 5 years. We tested the ability of two widely used soil organic matter models (RothC and Century) to predict carbon sequestration in Mediterranean forest soils.
   Increases in the top 5 cm of soil of about 10 g C m(-2) year(-1) were observed after afforestation of former vineyards, but nitrogen (N) either remained the same or decreased slightly. During afforestation, most organic matter accumulated in the ectorganic layers at a rate of 19 g C m(-2) year(-1) in former vineyards and 41 g C m(-2) year(-1) in former cereal fields. The RothC and Century models were sensitive to previous land use and estimated a carbon sequestration potential over 20 years of 950 and 700 g C m(-2), respectively. The accurate simulation of the dynamics of soil organic matter by RothC, together with measured above-ground inputs, allowed us to calculate below-ground inputs during afforestation. The Century model simulated total C and N, including the ectorganic horizons, well. Simulations showed a depletion of N in the below-ground fractions during afforestation, with N limitation in the former vineyard but not on former cereal land. The approach demonstrates the potential of models to enhance our understanding of the processes leading to carbon sequestration in soils.";"62";"WOS:000165610900008";2000;"afforest, plantat, stock, pine, layer";0.659557866652749;123

However, very few cost estimates of soil carbon sequestration strategies exist, and available data are not readily comparable. It is uncertain how large amounts of carbon could be sequestered, and it is unclear how well site-specific studies represent wider areas. It is concluded that there presently is a need to launch long-term (10 years) field experiments and demonstration and pilot projects for soil carbon sequestration in Africa.

Topsoils cropped with maize (Zea mays) under former charcoal production sites (N = 12) were identified in the field as black spots and had a larger (3.5%, P < 0.05) percentage of organic carbon (OC) contents than adjacent soil outside these spots (2.0%). The charcoal content varied with the detection technique used as follows: CTO-285 > DSC > Cr2O7. Black spots contained 1.6-1.7 times more (P < 0.05) maize-derived OC content than adjacent soil, irrespective of the BC quantification technique. The content of non-charcoal OC was 1.0-1.4 times larger in black spots than in adjacent soil, but differences were significant only for the Cr2O7 method. Soil physicochemical fractionation showed that at charcoal production sites more OC was recovered in the particulate organic matter and silt and clay fractions. The delta C-13 analysis suggested that additional maize-OC in black spots was in the physically more protected silt and clay fraction. Overall, this study shows that historical charcoal amendment in soil enhances the accumulation of recent maize-derived OC in a temperate climate without replacing the older C stocks.";"1";"WOS:000384745600009";2016;"degre, stabil, char, charcoal, decomposit";0.65894816634069;92
"Charcoal function and management in boreal ecosystems";"Hart, S
   Luckai, N";"Charcoal plays an important role in soil function and carbon storage in fire-prone ecosystems. Charcoal is present in most boreal forest soils as a result of naturally recurring wildfires, which convert 0.7-2% of biomass to charcoal. In boreal forests, charcoal represents 8-10% of soil carbon and 1 pg of carbon globally. Charcoal is resistant to decay, representing a form of super-passive carbon, with half-lives one to two orders of magnitude greater than those of other soil organic matter. High concentrations of negative surface charges increase nutrient retention, impacting boreal soil function, productivity and species composition. Due to a lack of soil mixing processes, charcoal in boreal soils is vulnerable to recombustion in recurring fires, inhibiting the accumulation of charcoal over time, unlike in other fire-prone ecosystems. Boreal charcoal stocks are highly variable. Increased fire intensity results in greater charcoal formation, with stand-replacing crown fires resulting in much larger charcoal stocks than non-stand-replacing ground fires. Current estimates of carbon storage based on Scandinavian studies of non-stand-replacing fires may underestimate charcoal stocks by factors of 2-3. Synthesis and applications. Charcoal contributes to boreal soil function, ecosystem productivity, nutrient retention and carbon cycling. In the absence of fire, charcoal loses many active properties, contributing to declining productivity with increasing time since fire. Incorporation of charcoal into ecosystem management using prescribed burns may contribute to sustainable management of boreal forests and maintaining global carbon cycles.";"8";"WOS:000325079800013";2013;"degre, stabil, char, charcoal, decomposit";0.651975165858371;92

The composition of condensed aromatic clusters appears to be an important determinant of the degradation rate of char in soil. The objective of the present study was to determine the size distribution of carbon layer planes in biochars produced from different types of feedstock (a broadleaf and a coniferous tree and two herbs) using different heating treatment temperatures (HIT; 400 degrees C-800 degrees C) using Xray diffraction 11 band profile analysis. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance with the phase-adjusted spinning side bands of the chars indicated different spectral features depending on the HIT and similar carbon composition among the plant types at each HIT. Both the content and composition of carbon layer planes in biochar produced using the same HTF were also similar among the plant types. The carbon layer plane size in the 400 degrees C and 600 degrees C chars was distributed from 0.24 to 1.68 or 1.92 nm (corresponding to 37 or 52 rings) with the mean size of 0.79-0.92 and 0.80-1.14 nm, respectively. The carbon layer planes in the 800 degrees C chars ranged from 0.72-0.96 nm (7-14 rings) to 2.64-3.60 nm (91-169 rings) and the mean values were 1.47-1.89 nm. The relative carbon layer plane content in the 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C chars was typically 2 and 3 times that in the 400 degrees C chars. These results indicate the progression of the formation and/or the size development of graphite-like structures, suggesting that a char produced at a higher HIT would have better carbon sequestrating characteristics.

Uncertainty associated with GHG emissions from indirect land use change, pasture soil emissions (e.g. soil carbon sequestration), enteric fermentation from cattle on pasture, and methane emissions from feedlot manure, respectively, contributed the most variability to life cycle GHG emissions from beef production. Feeding of coproducts from ethanol production was estimated to reduce life cycle emissions by 1.7%, but could increase emissions by 0.6-2.0% with higher feeding rates.

Methane, CO2 and N2O emission rates significantly (P<0.05) increased with higher rates of cover crop biomass incorporation under both irrigation conditions. However, intermittent drainage effectively reduced seasonal CH4 fluxes by ca. 42-46% and GWP by 17-31% compared to continuous flooding. Moreover, there were no significant differences in rice yield between the two water management practices with similar biomass incorporation rates.

   Brummer, EC";"The transition away from forage-based cropping systems in Iowa to corn and soybean rotations since World War 11 has corresponded with degraded economic and environmental conditions in the state. Falling net incomes for farmers and concern over global warming and the effects of agriculture-related pollution on water, wildlife and human health have increased interest in diversified cropping systems. This paper reviews the benefits of diversifying Iowa corn and soybean rotations with perennial forage species such as alfalfa and red clover. Perennial forage crops improve soil quality, decrease NO(3)-N leaching and soil erosion, increase carbon sequestration and decrease pesticide and herbicide needs by controlling weed and insect pests. Forage legumes reduce N fertilizer needs for succeeding corn crops at a higher rate than soybeans, and corn crops following forages have higher yields than after corn or soybeans. Farmers who add alfalfa to corn and soybean rotations could realize significant economic gains. A simulated 5-year rotation in Iowa including corn-soybeans-oats/alfalfa-alfalfa-alfalfa would result in a 24% net income increase over 5 years of corn-soybean-corn-soybean-corn, even with government farm support payments for the row crops. Farm policies that encourage commodity production create little incentive for Iowa farmers to diversify their cropping systems beyond corn and soybeans, despite the clear economic and ecological benefits. We recommend increasing federal support for conservation programs that reward environmentally beneficial farm practices such as the Conservation Securities Program and we encourage land grant universities to hire researchers interested in alternative agricultural systems.";"10";"WOS:000256533000002";2008;"farm, biodivers, food, agroforestri, program";0.611814722142133;94

The experiment was laid out in split plot design taking three crop establishment methods, furrow irrigated raised bed system (FIRBS), convential tillage (CT) and zero till (ZT) in main plots and three wheat cultivars, 711, WH 1022 and PBW 343 in sub-plots and three weed management practices, application of clodinafop fb metsulfuron @ 60 & 4 g/ha (C fb M), weedy check and weed free in sub-sub-plots replicated four times. The results revealed that establishment methods, wheat cultivars and weed management practices significantly affected weed populations and their dry weight, physiological traits and yield of wheat. Weed populations and their dry weight decreased significantly in FIRBS and ZT established crop and cultivar PBW 343. Application of C fb M was as effective as hand weeding in controlling weeds. Sowing of wheat on FIRBS, use of cultivar PBW 343 and control of weeds by C fb M resulted in higher leaf area index (LAI), leaf area duration (LAD) and crop growth rate (CGR) as compared to other treatments. The grain yield of wheat was higher in FIRBS than ZT and CT, in cultivar PBW 343 than WH 711 and WH 1022 and by the application of C fb M than weedy check. The interaction between establishment methods x weeding management practices and establishment methods x wheat cultivars was significant. The results revealed that application of C fb M in the crop planted on FIRBS provided effective control of weeds comparable to hand weeding in the crop planted either on FIRBS or ZT and CT. Cultivar PBW 343 produced highest grain yield under FIRBS and CT, whereas cultivar WH 711 performed better under ZT. The results revealed that among the physiological traits, LAI was the most critical trait influencing grain yield of wheat through its effect on LAD, CGR and biomass.";"0";"WOS:000322687200010";2013;"treatment, residu, miner, rice, straw";0.600693168963156;89

The 28- and 38-year-old plantations had 72 and 160 times the ecosystem biomass C storage, respectively, of areas with active sand dunes; the corresponding ecosystem biomass N storage was 48 and 105 times the value for areas with active dunes, versus 1.8 and 2.3 times for soil total C (organic plus inorganic) storage and 1.4 and 1.5 times for soil total N storage. The C and N accumulation rates in the plant-soil system were 678 kg C ha(-1) y(-1) and 23 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively, over 38 years. The remarkable effects of afforestation on soil C and N primarily appeared in the upper 20 cm of the soil. Our results indicated that afforestation of active sand dunes with Mongolian pine has high potential to sequester C and N in the plants and the soil. The biomass played a more important role than the soil for C sequestration, but the soil played a more important role than the biomass for N sequestration. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

But adoption is slow. Based on a critical problem solving approach and grounded theory as a strategy, we study agroforestry and subsistence agriculture as integrated, yet separate, socio-ecological systems with different organisational logics and temporal dynamics. Using 'narrative walks' as a qualitative method to construct grounded data, we explore the social and natural dimensions of the complex, diverse and uncertain landscape and life-worlds of subsistence agriculture. In the grounded analysis, we clarify how social stratification constructs incentives and disincentives to adopt agroforestry. To exemplify, food secure and opportunity seeking farmers may invest land and labour in trees, nurseries and social networks while risk evading farmers are constrained by the 'food imperative', the 'health imperative' and poverty in and of itself. By recognising material, symbolic and relational aspects we show how the ontology of global policies focussing on the merits of agroforestry differs from the ontology of everyday practices and strategies in subsistence agriculture. Such ontological stratification constitutes another constraint to agroforestry adoption as a comprehensive form of socio-technological change. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is no consensus on soil organic carbon (SOC) content and CO2 emissions as affected by soil management practices and their relationships with soil texture. No-till (NT) agriculture often results in soil C gain, though, not always. Soil net CO2 exchange rate (NCER) and environmental factors (SOC, soil temperature [T-soil], and water content [W-soil]), as affected by soil type (loam and sandy loam), tillage (conventional, reduced, and NT), and fertilization, were quantified in long-term field experiments in Lithuania. Soil tillage and fertilization affected total CO2 flux (heterotrophic and autotrophic) through effect on soil SOC sequestration, water, and temperature regime. After 11 yr of different tillage and fertilization management, SOC content was 23% more in loam than in sandy loam. Long-term NT contributed to 7 to 27% more SOC sequestration on loam and to 29 to 33% more on sandy loam compared with reduced tillage (RT) or conventional tillage (CT). Soil water content in loam was 7% more than in sandy loam. Soil gravimetric water content, averaged across measurement dates and fertilization treatments, was significantly less in NT than CT and RT in both soils. Soil organic carbon content and water storage capacity of the loam and sandy loam soils exerted different influences on NCER. The NCER from the sandy loam soil was 13% greater than that from the loam. In addition, NCER was 4 to 9% less with NT than with CT and RT systems on both loam and sandy loam soils.

Recent data suggest that the carbon stock of soil in UK arable land has been overestimated, meaning that potential soil carbon sequestration rates were also overestimated. Here, we present a new estimate of the carbon stock in UK arable land, and present revised estimates for the carbon mitigation potential of UK agricultural land. The stock of soil organic carbon in UK arable land (0-30 cm) is estimated to be 562 Tg, about half of the previous estimate. Consequently, the soil carbon sequestration component of each mitigation option is reduced by about half of previously published values. Since above-ground carbon accumulation and fossil fuel carbon savings remain unchanged by these new soil carbon data, options with a significant non-soil carbon mitigation component are reduced by less than those resulting from soil carbon sequestration alone. The best single mitigation option (bioenergy crop production on surplus arable land) accounts for 3.5 Tg Cyr(-1), (2.2% of the UK's 1990 CO2-carbon emissions), whilst an optimal combined land-use mitigation option accounts for 6.1 Tg Cyr(-1) (3.9% of the UK's 1990 CO2-carbon emissions). These revised figures suggest that through manipulation of arable land, the UK; could, at best, meet 49% of its contribution to the EU's overall Kyoto CO2-carbon emission reduction target (8% of 1990 emissions), and 31% of the greater target accepted by the UK (12.5%).

   Miles, A";"We hypothesize that biological diversification across ecological, spatial, and temporal scales maintains and regenerates the ecosystem services that provide critical inputs-such as maintenance of soil quality, nitrogen fixation, pollination, and pest control-to agriculture. Agrobiodiversity is sustained by diversified farming practices and it also supplies multiple ecosystem services to agriculture, thus reducing environmental externalities and the need for off-farm inputs. We reviewed the literature that compares biologically diversified farming systems with conventional farming systems, and we examined 12 ecosystem services: biodiversity; soil quality; nutrient management; water-holding capacity; control of weeds, diseases, and pests; pollination services; carbon sequestration; energy efficiency and reduction of warming potential; resistance and resilience to climate change; and crop productivity. We found that compared with conventional farming systems, diversified farming systems support substantially greater biodiversity, soil quality, carbon sequestration, and water-holding capacity in surface soils, energy-use efficiency, and resistance and resilience to climate change. Relative to conventional monocultures, diversified farming systems also enhance control of weeds, diseases, and arthropod pests and they increase pollination services; however, available evidence suggests that these practices may often be insufficient to control pests and diseases or provide sufficient pollination. Significantly less public funding has been applied to agroecological research and the improvement of diversified farming systems than to conventional systems. Despite this lack of support, diversified farming systems have only somewhat reduced mean crop productivity relative to conventional farming systems, but they produce far fewer environmental and social harms. We recommend that more research and crop breeding be conducted to improve diversified farming systems and reduce yield gaps when they occur. Because single diversified farming system practices, such as crop rotation, influence multiple ecosystem services, such research should be holistic and integrated across many components of the farming system. Detailed agroecological research especially is needed to develop crop- and region-specific approaches to control of weeds, diseases, and pests.";"77";"WOS:000313417400012";2012;"farm, biodivers, food, agroforestri, program";0.573708665581685;94

The four experimental sites, situated in the Western Rhodope Mountains (Bulgaria) were characterized by typical forest-related land-use conversions. The four sites were a Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) plantation (Rd1) established on former cropland, a mixed black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantation (Rd2) established on former cropland, a cropland (RdA1) and an abandoned land with uncontrolled extensive grazing (RdA2) historically used as cropland. Soil parameters, i.e., sand content, pH, organic C and N contents, C/N ratio and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, were significantly affected by land use and land-use history. Conversion from cropland into forestland significantly reduced soil bulk density and coarse fragments at 0-10 cm depth. Compared with adjacent cropland and abandoned land, soils in coniferous plantations were acidified in their upper layers. Sites Rd2 and RdA2 contained the least SOC owing to the previous long-term arable cultivation (> 100 years). Analysis of the ecosystem C stock distribution revealed that most of C in forests was stored in the aboveground tree biomass. Our study confirmed that afforestation of cropland turned the soil into a C sink for the selected mountain region, but showed conflicting results when afforestation occurred on abandoned cropland.";"0";"WOS:000384724700015";2016;"afforest, plantat, stock, pine, layer";0.557169807786895;123

   Kirk-Davidoff, D";"A carbon sequestration strategy has recently been proposed in which a forest is actively managed, and a fraction of the wood is selectively harvested and stored to prevent decomposition. The forest serves as a 'carbon scrubber' or 'carbon remover' that provides continuous sequestration (negative emissions). Earlier estimates of the theoretical potential of wood harvest and storage (WHS) based on coarse wood production rates were 10 +/- 5 GtC y(-1). Starting from this physical limit, here we apply a number of practical constraints: (1) land not available due to agriculture; (2) forest set aside as protected areas, assuming 50 % in the tropics and 20 % in temperate and boreal forests; (3) forests difficult to access due to steep terrain; (4) wood use for other purposes such as timber and paper. This 'top-down' approach yields a WHS potential 2.8 GtC y(-1). Alternatively, a 'bottom-up' approach, assuming more efficient wood use without increasing harvest, finds 0.1-0.5 GtC y(-1) available for carbon sequestration. We suggest a range of 1-3 GtC y(-1) carbon sequestration potential if major effort is made to expand managed forests and/or to increase harvest intensity. The implementation of such a scheme at our estimated lower value of 1 GtC y(-1) would imply a doubling of the current world wood harvest rate. This can be achieved by harvesting wood at a moderate harvesting intensity of 1.2 tC ha(-1) y(-1), over a forest area of 8 Mkm(2) (800 Mha). To achieve the higher value of 3 GtC y(-1), forests need to be managed this way on half of the world's forested land, or on a smaller area but with higher harvest intensity. We recommend WHS be considered part of the portfolio of climate mitigation and adaptation options that needs further research.";"4";"WOS:000317926800007";2013;"harvest, rotat, wood, simul, ton";0.552934744467506;53

Management of these lands with a wide range of existing, site-specific, integrated, agroforest systems represents a significant global opportunity to reduce the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Establishment of extensive agricultural, agroforest, and alternative land-use systems on marginal or degraded lands could sequester 0.82-2.2 Pg carbon (C) per year, globally, over a 50-year time-frame. Moreover, slowing soil degradation by alternative grassland management and by impeding desertification could conserve up to 0.5-1.5 Pg C annually, A global analysis of biologic and economic data from 94 nations representing diverse climatic and edaphic conditions reveals a range of integrated land-use systems which could be used to establish and manage vegetation on marginal or degraded lands. Promising land-use systems and practices identified to conserve and temporarily store C include agroforestry systems, fuelwood and fiber plantations, bioreserves, intercropping systems, and shelterbelts/windbreaks. For example, successful establishment of low-intensity agroforestry systems can store up to 70 Mg C/ha in boreal, temperate and tropical ecoregions. The mean initial cost of soil rehabilitation and revegetation ranges from $500-3,000/ha for the 94 nations surveyed.  Natural regeneration of woody vegetation or agro-afforestation establishment costs were less than $1000/ha in temperate and tropical regions.  The costs of C sequestration in soil and vegetation systems range from $1-69/Mg C, which compares favorably with other options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere.  Although agroforestry system projects were recently established to conserve and sequester C in Guatemala and Malaysia, constraints to wide-spread implementation include social conditions (demographic factors, land tenure issues, market conditions, lack of infrastructure), economic obstacles (difficulty of demonstrating benefits of alternative systems, capital requirements, lack of financial incentives) and, ecologic considerations (limited knowledge of impacts and sustainability of some systems).";"47";"WOS:A1994NU08100007";1994;"farm, biodivers, food, agroforestri, program";0.546987844065699;94

The larger concentration near the surface in no-till is generally beneficial for soil properties that often, though not always, translate into improved crop growth. In many regions where no-till is practised it is common for soil to be cultivated conventionally every few years for a range of agronomic reasons, so any soil carbon benefit is then lost.

Further, there is considerable interest in the use of straw for industrial purposes. Using soil samples taken from the 0- to 7.5-cm and 7.5- to 15-cm depths in May 1987 and September 1996, we determined organic C and total N in five crop rotations (nine treatments) using automated Carlo Erba combustion analyzer. The experiment was managed using conventional mechanical tillage from 1957 to 1989; it was changed to no-tillage management in 1990. Our objective was to determine: (a) if change to no-tillage management had changed soil C and N storage, and (b) if method of calculating organic C and N change would influence interpretation of the results. All three methods of calculation confirmed the efficacy of employing best management practices (e.g., fertilization based on soil tests, reducing summerfallow, including legumes in rotations) for increasing or maintaining soil organic matter, and showed that the latter was directly associated with the amount of crop residues returned to the soil. Where bulk density was significantly different between sampling times, the often used mass per fixed depth (MFD) (i.e., volume basis) calculation can lead to erroneous conclusions. When the recently recommended mass per equal depth (MED) method of calculation was used, it showed that 6 yr of no-tillage did not increase soil organic C or total N. However, in unfertilized systems, where crop yields are gradually decreasing since the change, there is an accompanying decrease in organic matter, while fertilized, or high-fertility systems that include legume hay crops, in which wheat yields have been maintained have tended to maintain the organic matter level over time. When the MFD calculation was used, there was no change in C over time when straw was harvested in the F-W-W system; however, the MED calculation and concentrations tend to show a decrease in soil C and N. This suggests that in time, industrial use of straw may have negative consequences for soil conservation.

This paper summarizes recent (2000-2008) rates of extraction, including both conversion and harvest, derived from national forest inventories for North America (the United States, Canada, and Mexico). During the 2000s, 6.1 million ha/yr were affected by harvest, another 1.0 million ha/yr were converted to other land uses through gross deforestation, and 0.4 million ha/yr were degraded. Thus about 1.0% of North America's forests experienced some form of anthropogenic disturbance each year. However, due to harvest recovery, afforestation, and reforestation, the total forest area on the continent has been roughly stable during the decade. On average, about 110 m(3) of roundwood volume was extracted per hectare harvested across the continent. Patterns of extraction vary among the three countries, with U.S. and Canadian activity dominated by partial and clear-cut harvest, respectively, and activity in Mexico dominated by conversion (deforestation) for agriculture. Temporal trends in harvest and clearing may be affected by economic variables, technology, and forest policy decisions. While overall rates of extraction appear fairly stable in all three countries since the 1980s, harvest within the United States has shifted toward the southern United States and away from the Pacific Northwest.";"33";"WOS:000289648300002";2011;"harvest, rotat, wood, simul, ton";0.525906731271572;53
"SIMPLOT: Simulating the impacts of fire severity on sustainability of

   Tome, M";"SIMPLOT is a forest simulator for eucalyptus mainly driven by wood demand. It was developed to predict the evolution of the eucalyptus plantations in Portugal by combining forest inventory data with growth models taking into account the effect of different drivers such as wood demand, hazards occurrence and percentage of land use changes. The use of simulators for scenario analysis can be a powerful tool to explore policy options and to illustrate the consequences of different management alternatives. In the past years Portugal has been marked by extremely severe forest fires of great environmental impact. This paper shows simulation runs for two main scenario lines: the wood demand line and the wildfires line. In the first one, the simulator is used to identify a reasonable wood demand out of three different wood demands combined with a low/medium intensity fire scenario. The selected wood demand combined with three fire scenarios of increasing severity and a fourth one disregarding the existence of recent severe wildfires builds the second scenario line. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of different magnitudes of forest fires occurrence on the sustainability of eucalyptus plantations starting with NFI data gathered in 1997 during a horizon of 28 years. The simulations reflect a constant level of afforestation and deforestation and assume that no changes took place between different management alternatives. These simulations provide some insight on the impact of different wood demand and different magnitudes/frequency of severe wildfires: it is not only the number and magnitude of severe wildfires that make a difference, but it is also the number and magnitude of medium wildfires that follow an extremely severe one. Furthermore, the inter-annual variability of wildfire occurrence affects carbon stock and carbon sequestration in a different way. The occurrence of severe wildfires has an immediate effect on carbon sequestration. The lower values are registered in the same year in which the most severe wildfires occur. On the other hand, the occurrence of severe wildfires has more permanent consequences on carbon stocks than on carbon sequestration. The more severe and numerous are the wildfires the more difficult and at long-term will be to recover the carbon stocks in the forest. Results have also shown that if a higher wood demand compatible with the expected increase of pulp industry capacity would have been considered this would have had drastic impacts on eucalyptus forest sustainability due to overharvesting in order to meet the desired wood demand.

Drainage-induced C emission rate was estimated to range from 12.5 to 32.5 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Our extrapolation of the C emission rate to the entire peatland area of 240 km(2) in Turkey resulted in CO(2) emissions of 0.30-0.78 Mt in 2009, equivalent to 0.01%-0.02% of the global LULC-related CO(2) emissions of 3230 Mt in 2009.

"Ecological implications of village bamboo as global climate change
   mitigation strategy A case study in Barak Valley, Assam, North East
   India";"Nath, AJ
   Das, AK";"Purpose - The present study seeks to evaluate the role of village bamboo management in the rural landscape of North East India in global climate change mitigation.
   Design/methodology/approach - A set of 100 home gardens and 40 bamboo groves were selected from Irongmara and Dargakona village, in Cachar district, Assam, North East India through random sampling. Sampling was done mostly for smallholders. Culm growth, carbon storage, carbon sequestration and carbon in litter floor mass and soil of bamboo growing areas in homegarden was explored from 2003-2007.
   Findings - Culm growth extension revealed the brief periodicity of culm growth in a single growth period. Of the total carbon storage soil contributed 84.6 per cent of the total (50.1 Mg ha(-1)) followed by carbon in above ground vegetation 15 per cent (9 Mg ha(-1)) and carbon in litter floor mass 0.4 per cent (0.2 Mg ha(-1)).
   Practical implications - Bamboo plantation development and its management in home gardens has social, ecological and economical benefits for the rural life in North East India and its promotion can become an effective choice for climate change mitigation strategy.
   Originality/value - Bamboo forms an important component in the traditional home garden system of North East India where the practice of bamboo cultivation and management provides an important sink for CO2. Village bamboos play an important role in local economics, societies and environments and, considering its potential to mitigate global climate change, the authors recommend the promotion of bamboo in agroforestry expanding practices and rehabilitation of degraded lands. Management of village bamboos in rural landscape is highlighted in context to environmental sustainability and as a sink measure under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of Kyoto Protocol.";"3";"WOS:000305664700006";2012;"harvest, rotat, wood, simul, ton";0.449348959336066;53
"Landscape-scale modelling of erosion processes and soil carbon dynamics
   under land-use and climate change in agroecosystems";"Lacoste, M
   Viaud, V
   Michot, D
   Walter, C";"Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and soil redistribution are linked to soil properties, land use, farming system and climate. In a global-change context, landscape and climate changes are expected and will most probably have impacts on changes in the soil. Soil change was simulated from 2010 to 2100 in an 86-ha hedgerow landscape under different scenarios of landscape and climate changes. These scenarios combined contrasting land uses, hedgerow networks and climates. Two models were combined to evaluate the impact of these scenarios on soils: LandSoil, a soil redistribution model, and a SOC model based on RothC-26.3. A soil thickness of 105cm was considered. The results indicate that the main factor influencing soil degradation was land-use change: when compared with the baseline business-as-usual landscape, the landscape with the most intensive agricultural systems had the greatest soil erosion (+0.26tha(-1)year(-1)) and reduced mean SOC stocks (-17tha(-1) after 90years). The second significant factor was climate change, followed by hedgerow network density. Sensitivity to climate change differed between landscapes, and the most sensitive were those with continuous winter wheat. The results indicate that a hedgerow landscape is well adapted to protect soil (regarding carbon storage and soil erosion) in a context of climate change. However, this type of landscape is highly sensitive to cropping intensification and should be protected.";"5";"WOS:000357341900016";2015;"harvest, rotat, wood, simul, ton";0.427240708766683;53
